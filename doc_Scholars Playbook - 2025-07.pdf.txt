Chapter  1:  Introduction  &  Strategic  Planning    
Scholars  Must-Haves  
Every  successful  Scholars  location  focuses  on  four  “must-have”  systems.  These  systems  ensure  that  you  
are
 
focused
 
on
 
the
 
most
 
important
 
overarching
 
concepts
 
for
 
the
 
optimal
 
implementation
 
of
 
core
 
systems
 
to
 
set
 
yourself
 
up
 
for
 
success
 
and
 
growth!
 
You
 
will
 
learn
 
more
 
about
 
each
 
one
 
of
 
these
 
must-haves
 
throughout
 
this
 
playbook.
 
To
 
begin,
 
here’s
 
a
 
quick
 
reference
 
guide:
  
★  The  Strategic  Growth  System  ○  Focusing  on  working  “on”  the  business  rather  than  just  “in”  the  business  
★  The  Marketing  Machine  ○  Making  your  presence  known  through  a  combination  of  digital-traditional-community  
initiatives
 
★  The  Scholars  Sales  Program  ○  Solution-based  inquiry  and  conversion  conversations  
★  The  Scholars  Experience  ○  Happy  Parents  +  Happy  Students  +  Eﬀective  Programs

Chapter  1:  Introduction  &  Strategic  Planning    
Strategic  Planning  &  The  Entrepreneurial  Operating  
System®
 
(EOS)
 
For  Head  Oﬃce  down  to  every  location,  Scholars  strategic  planning  operates  using  the  foundations  of  
The
 
Entrepreneurial
 
Operating
 
System®
 
(EOS).
 
The
 
EOS
 
Model®
 
focuses
 
on
 
the
 
Six
 
Key
 
Components™
 
of
 
any
 
business
 
that
 
must
 
be
 
managed
 
and
 
strengthened
 
to
 
become
 
a
 
great
 
business.
 
You
 
can
 
ﬁnd
 additional  information  and  resources  about  EOS  here.   
  ★  Vision:   ○  Strengthening  this  component  means  getting  everyone  in  the  organization  100%  on  the  
same
 
page
 
with
 
where
 
you’re
 
going
 
and
 
how
 
you’re
 
going
 
to
 
get
 
there.
 
★  People:   ○  Simply  put,  we  can’t  do  it  without  great  people.  This  means  surrounding  yourself  with  
great
 
people,
 
top
 
to
 
bottom,
 
because
 
you
 
can’t
 
achieve
 
a
 
great
 
vision
 
without
 
a
 
great
 
team.
 
★  Data:   ○  This  means  cutting  through  all  the  feelings,  personalities,  opinions,  and  egos  and  boiling  
your
 
organization
 
down
 
to
 
a
 
handful
 
of
 
objective
 
numbers
 
that
 
give
 
you
 
an
 
absolute
 
pulse
 
on
 
where
 
things
 
are.

Chapter  1:  Introduction  &  Strategic  Planning    
With  the  Vision,  People,  and  Data  Components  strong,  you  start   
to
 
create
 
a
 
lucid,
 
transparent,
 
open
 
and
 
honest
 
organization
 
 
where
 
everything
 
becomes
 
more
 
visible
 
and
 
you
 
start
 
to
 
 
“smoke
 
out
 
all
 
the
 
issues,”
 
which
 
leads
 
to… 
★  Issues:   ○  Strengthening  this  component  means  becoming  great  at  solving  problems  throughout  the  
organization
 
–
 
setting
 
them
 
up,
 
knocking
 
them
 
down,
 
and
 
making
 
them
 
go
 
away
 
forever.
 
★  Process:   ○  This  is  the  secret  ingredient  in  your  organization.  This  means  “systemizing”  your  business  
by
 
identifying
 
and
 
documenting
 
the
 
core
 
processes
 
that
 
deﬁne
 
the
 
way
 
to
 
run
 
your
 
business.
 
You'll
 
need
 
to
 
get
 
everyone
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
page
 
with
 
what
 
the
 
essential
 
procedural
 
steps
 
are,
 
and
 
then
 
get
 
everyone
 
to
 
follow
 
them
 
to
 
create
 
consistency
 
and
 
scalability
 
in
 
your
 
organization.
 
★  Traction®:   ○  This  means  bringing  discipline  and  accountability  into  the  organization  –  becoming  great  
at
 
execution
 
–
 
taking
 
the
 
vision
 
down
 
to
 
the
 
ground
 
and
 
making
 
it
 
real.
  ( The  EOS  Model®)  
Yearly  Strategic  Plan  Hub  To  coincide  with  EOS  methodology  and  Scholars  Must-Have:  The  Strategic  Growth  System,  you  will  ﬁnd  a  
variety
 
of
 
diﬀerent
 
tools
 
and
 
templates
 
in
 
the
 
Scholars
 
Google
 
Drive
 
Documents
 
folder
 
shared
 
with
 
each
 
Scholars
 
location.
 
These
 
resources
 
have
 
been
 
built
 
-
 
and
 
housed
 
within
 
a
 
Yearly
 
Strategic
 
Plan
 
Hub
 
document
 
to
 
centralize
 
your
 
ideas,
 
plans,
 
visions,
 
tracking,
 
analysis,
 
and
 
reﬂection!  ★  One-Page  Plan  ○  The  One-Page  Plan  is  considered  to  be  the  “cover  letter”  of  your  annual  strategic  plan.  
Consider
 
this
 
the
 
one
 
page
 
that
 
every
 
employee
 
could
 
have
 
in
 
their
 
pocket
 
or
 
in
 
their
 
personal
 
planner
 
that
 
summarizes
 
where
 
you
 
are
 
going
 
and
 
what
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
do
 
to
 
get
 
there.
 ○  From  a  year-long  perspective,  you  are  determining  your  Wildly  Important  Goals®  (WIG®)  
for
 
each
 
of
 
the
 
Scholars
 
Must-Haves
 
and
 
the
 
metrics
 
that
 
align
 
with
 
these
 
WIGS.

Chapter  1:  Introduction  &  Strategic  Planning    ○  You  then  will  break  down  your  WIGs  into  digestible  quarterly  “rocks”  with  metrics  that  
align
 
with
 
the
 
same.
 
★  Financial  Projections  ○  To  support  your  ﬁnancial  projections  in  your  One-Page  Plan,  the  Financial  Projections  tool  
allows
 
you
 
to
 
input
 
your
 
projected
 
income
 
and
 
expenses,
 
along
 
with
 
testing
 
proactive
 
and
 
passive
 
strategies
 
for
 
optimization
 
and
 
eﬃciencies.
 
★  Annual  Marketing  Plan  ○  There  are  two  tabs  for  the  Annual  Marketing  Plan  ■  One  that  includes  steps  to  complete  alongside  a  sample  launch  quarter  for  a  new  
location
 ■  One  that  oﬀers  a  template  to  develop  the  detailed  plans  associated  with  your  
Scholars
 
Must-Have:
 
The
 
Marketing
 
Machine
 
★  Social  Media  Calendar  ○  This  tab  facilitates  the  brainstorming  and  tracking  of  your  locally  driven  social  media  
content.
 
 
★  SWOT:  Competitive  Analysis  ○  It’s  essential  to  conduct  frequent  competitive  analyses  to  learn  about  your  local  
competition
 
-
 
at
 
least
 
once
 
a
 
year.
 
 ■  Although  you  can  ﬁnd  some  general  information  online  about  many  competitors,  
everyone
 
claims
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
best!
 
What
 
you
 
are
 
truly
 
looking
 
for
 
is
 
how
 
your
 
local
 
Oxford,
 
Sylvan,
 
Kumon,
 
and
 
even
 
Jo-Mo's
 
Tutoring
 
present
 
themselves.
 
 ○  You  will  ﬁnd  a  SWOT:  Competitive  Analysis  Summary  tab  alongside  a  SWOT:  Competitor  
Call
 
Scorecard
 
in
 
your
 
Yearly
 
Strategic
 
Plan
 
Hub
 
 
★  Community  Schools  List  ○  This  tab  gives  you  the  space  to  compile  a  list  of  schools  in  your  community,  including  any  
additional
 
notes
 
about
 
the
 
type
 
of
 
school
 
and
 
any
 
specialties
 
they
 
oﬀer
 
(French
 
Immersion,
 
AP/IB
 
programs,
 
etc.).
 
 ○  This  will  ensure  you  have  a  ﬁrm  grasp  of  the  schools  in  your  community  to  help  you  be  
prepared
 
and
 
conﬁdent
 
when
 
speaking
 
with
 
leads. 
★  FRANK  List  ○  The  FRANK  (Friends,  Relatives,  Acquaintances,  Neighbours,  and  Kid  Contacts)  List  is  a  
quick
 
brainstorming
 
tool
 
to
 
consider
 
the
 
connections
 
you
 
have
 
made
 
-
 
and
 
will
 
make
 
-
 
in
 
your
 
community.

Chapter  1:  Introduction  &  Strategic  Planning    ★  Community  Events  List  ○  Over  the  course  of  determining  local  marketing  opportunities  to  fulﬁll  your  4+1  Local  Marketing  Buckets,  your  review  of  community  schools,  considering  your  connections  in  your  FRANK  list,  this  tab  is  the  perfect  space  to  collect  event  information  to  follow-up  on  
or
 
action!
 
 
★  L10  Tools:  Agenda,  Scorecard,  Rocks,  To-Dos,  and  Issues  ○  As  part  of  the Entrepreneurial  Operating  System®  (EOS®),  the  Level  10  Meeting  (L10)   establishes  a  consistent,  weekly  meeting  pulse  to  optimize  your  management  team’s

time
 
by
 
being
 
able
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
the
 
most
 
important
 
items
 
each

Chapter  2:  Sales    
Behavioural  Economics   
Sales  is  communication.  But  some  educators  ﬁnd  themselves  averse  to  sales.  This  is  the  reason  that  we  
have
 
not
 
made
 
this
 
about
 
selling
 
widgets,
 
after
 
all,
 
we
 
are
 
here
 
to
 
help
 
students
 
succeed.
 
We
 
base
 
our
 
sales
 
and
 
enrollment
 
process
 
on
 
the
 
principles
 
of
 
behavioural
 
economics.
 
Behavioural
 
economics
 
studies
 
the
 
eﬀects
 
of
 
psychological,
 
cognitive,
 
emotional,
 
cultural
,
 
and
 
social
 
factors
 
on
 
the
 
economic
 
decisions
 
of
 
individuals
 
and
 
institutions,
 
and
 
how
 
those
 
decisions
 
vary
 
from
 
those
 
implied
 
by
 
classical
 
theory.
 
In
 
short,
 
behavioural
 
economics
 
explains
 
the
 
decision-making
 
process
 
your
 
prospective
 
clients
 
are
 
going
 
through
 
when
 
they
 
are
 
deciding
 
whether
 
or
 
not
 
to
 
enroll
 
their
 
dependant
 
at
 
Scholars
.
 
The
 
best
 
way
 
to
 
evoke
 
the
 
ﬁve
 
factors
 
mentioned
 
above
 
in
 
a
 
parent/guardian
 
is
 
through
 
a
 
question-based
 
approach
,
 
which
 
we
 
employ
 
when
 
taking
 
inquiry,
 
no
 
matter
 
what
 
format
 
they
 
are
 
received
 
-
 
call,
 
email,
 
walk-in,
 
or
 
e-lead.
 
  
Question-Based  Approach  to  Increasing  Revenue   
As  many  franchisees  and/or  management  staﬀ  are  passionate  about  education  and  have  spent  most  of  
their
 
careers
 
teaching,
 
they
 
often
 
have
 
limited
 
sales
 
experience.
 
We
 
can
 
solve
 
this
 
obstacle
 
by
 
connecting
 
with
 
parents/guardians
 
through
 
a
 
genuine
 
conversation
 
and
 
show
 
that
 
we
 
truly
 
care
 
about
 
helping
 
their
 
child
 
reach
 
their
 
potential.
 
If
 
we
 
do
 
not
 
build
 
credibility
 
as
 
an
 
academic
 
expert,
 
it
 
is
 
diﬃcult
 
to
 
sell
 
to
 
someone
 
who
 
is
 
cautious
 
and
 
reluctant.
 
  
You  need  to  earn  the  right  to  engage.  After  all,  you  are  a  stranger   at  this  point  asking  questions  about  someone’s  child.   The  alternative  we  see  is  people  overcompensating  by  commoditizing  Scholars’  value.  From  our  review  
of
 
CallRail
 
recordings,
 
we
 
have
 
heard
 
franchisees
 
read
 
program
 
information
 
oﬀ
 
the
 
website
 
or
 
the
 
Parent
 
Guide,
 
which
 
is
 
a
 
far
 
less
 
eﬃcient
 
approach.
 
We
 
are
 
not
 
taking
 
a
 
pizza
 
order;
 
parents/guardians
 
are
 
evaluating
 
our
 
ability
 
to
 
help
 
their
 
child
 
become
 
more
 
successful
 
in
 
life.
 
Ultimately,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
deliver
 
competence
,
 
credibility
,
 
and
 
value
 
to
 
every
 
family.
  Whether  on  the  phone,  email,  or  in-person,  asking  for  a  name,  number,  and  other  “boring”  information  
before
 
you
 
have
 
earned
 
that
 
right
 
lowers
 
your
 
chance
 
of

the

These
 
are
 
considered
 
“boring”
 
questions
 
because
 
the
 
caller
 
already
 
knows
 
all
 
of
 
this
 
information;
 
they
 
want
 
you
 
to
 
educate
 
them
 
on
 
why
 
Scholars
 
is
 
the
 
solution.
 
  Get  parents/guardians  to  share  information  without  just  going  down  the  list  and  ﬁlling  in  the  blanks  like  
you
 
are
 
taking
 
that
 
pizza
 
order!

Chapter  2:  Sales    ★  Listen  to  the  Problems  ○  Leverage  curiosity  by  asking  diagnostic  questions  
★  Understand  the  Alternatives  ○  Review  the  investment-justiﬁcation  of  the  purchase.  Remember:  investment  is  not  just  
from
 
a
 
ﬁnancial
 
standpoint
 
-
 
consider
 
the
 
time,
 
money,
 
and
 
energy
 
investment.
 
★  Oﬀer  the  Scholars  Solution  ○  Demonstrate  the  competence,  credibility,  and  value   
Securing  a  Prospective  Client’s  Time  To  succeed,  you  need  to  secure  your  prospective  client’s  time .  Do  not  rush  through  an  inquiry.  If  more  
time
 
is
 
needed,
 
book
 
a
 
follow-up
 
call
 
or
 
location
 
visit
 
to
 
continue
 
the
 
conversation.
 
Make
 
sure
 
that
 
every
 
call
 
or
 
meeting
 
is
 
booked
 
in
 
your
 
location’s
 
Google
 
Calendar.
 
Further,
 
send
 
them
 
an
 
invitation
 
which
 
includes
 
your
 
location
 
address
 
and
 
any
 
other
 
information
 
that
 
adds
 
value
 
to
 
the
 
process,
 
and
 
therefore
 
moves
 
them
 
closer
 
to
 
becoming
 
enrolled
 
in
 
our
 
program.
 
This
 
also
 
means
 
that
 
you
 
are
 
not
 
sharing
 
their
 
time
 
with
 
someone
 
else
 
and
 
you
 
have
 
their
 
full
 
attention.
 
Obviously,
 
if
 
they
 
are
 
connecting
 
with
 
you
 
for
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
time,
 
we
 
know
 
they
 
have
 
made
 
the
 
time
 
and
 
there
 
is
 
no
 
better
 
opportunity
 
to
 
schedule
 
them
 
for
 
a
 
visit,
 
or
 
a
 
complimentary
 
assessment
 
or
 
trial
 
hour.
  To  secure  their  time,  in  something  as  emotionally  driven  as  the  academic  success  of  a  child,  superﬁcial  
and
 
generic
 
phrases
 
are
 
the
 
enemy.
 
Speciﬁcity
 
and
 
purpose
 
are
 
your
 
friends
.
 
Trying
 
to
 
claim
 
our
 
own
 
greatness
 
tends
 
to
 
backﬁre,
 
causing
 
prospective
 
clients
 
to
 
withdraw
 
even
 
further.
 
That’s
 
because
 
starting
 
with
 
the
 
traditional
 
elevator
 
pitch
 
is
 
the
 
quickest
 
way
 
to
 
commoditize
 
our
 
value.
 
  Which  of  our  competitors  doesn’t  claim  to  be  the  best?  They  all  do!  In  which  case,  if  we  sound  just  like  
everyone
 
else,
 
we
 
forfeit
 
our
 
competitive
 
advantage.
 
Everyone
 
claims
 
to
 
be
 
great,
 
but
 
not
 
everyone
 
demonstrates
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
valuable
 
asset.
  By  demonstrating  that  you  know  how  to  ask  intelligent  and  relevant  questions,  you  will  communicate  a   
higher
 
level
 
of
 
competence
,
 
credibility
,
 
and
 
value
.
 
In
 
order
 
for
 
your
 
passion
 
for
 
education
 
to
 
be
 
conveyed,
 
we
 
do
 
not
 
suggest
 
reading
 
from
 
a
 
script.
 
  
Establishing  Credibility  
We  talked  about  piquing  your  client’s  curiosity  to  secure  their  time  and  attention.  Now,  it’s  time  to  focus  
on
 
establishing
 
credibility
 
early
 
in
 
the
 
conversation.
 
In
 
order
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
have
 
an
 
opportunity
 
to
 
uncover
 
needs,
 
present
 
solutions,
 
and
 
ask
 
for
 
a
 
commitment,
 
parents/guardians
 
must
 
ﬁrst
 
perceive
 
you
 
as

Chapter  2:  Sales    credible.  The  greater  your  credibility,  the  more  parents/guardians  will  trust  you  and  the  more  comfortable  
they
 
will
 
feel.
  Validating  information  that  you  have  already  collected  will  help  your  credibility  because  it  demonstrates  
to
 
the
 
parent/guardian
 
that
 
you
 
have
 
actively
 
listened
 
and/or
 
done
 
your
 
homework
 
in
 
advance.
 
It
 
also
 
gives
 
you
 
an
 
opportunity
 
to
 
verify
 
that
 
this
 
information
 
is
 
indeed
 
correct.
 
Of
 
course,
 
you
 
can
 
ask
 
questions
 
to
 
gather
 
new
 
information
 
as
 
well.
 
As
 
you
 
establish
 
credibility,
 
the
 
parent/guardian
 
will
 
come
 
alive.
 
The
 
best
 
sales
 
interactions
 
turn
 
into
 
a
 
conversation
 
with
 
both
 
parties
 
sharing
 
information
 
and
 
ideas,
 
as
 
opposed
 
to
 
a
 
one-way
 
dump
 
of
 
information.
  If  you  ask  intelligent  and  relevant  questions,  you  prove  that  you  are  a  valuable  resource  that  the  client  
requires
 
and
 
trusts.
 
This
 
puts
 
you
 
in
 
a
 
great
 
position
 
and
 
gives
 
you
 
an
 
opportunity
 
to
 
provide
 
valuable
 
solutions.
  You  can  gain  a  client’s  conﬁdence  by  asking  speciﬁc  questions  that  demonstrate  a  higher  level  of  
competence
 
and
 
credibility.
 
You
 
want
 
to
 
understand
 
the
 
client’s
 
goals,
 
objectives,
 
and
 
expectations
 
since
 
you
 
cannot
 
propose
 
a
 
valuable
 
solution
 
without
 
ﬁrst
 
understanding
 
the
 
child’s
 
root
 
issues.
  We  have  such  an  easy  sell:  supporting  every  student  in  reaching  their  full  potential .  We  need  to  
convey
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
indeed
 
making
 
a
 
great
 
decision
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
move
 
forward
 
through
 
the
 
enrollment
 
process.
  Beginning  a  conversation  with  a  series  of  rehearsed  lines  puts  you  in  an  extremely  weak  position.  
Tutoring
 
is
 
a
 
competitive
 
market
 
-
 
there
 
is
 
nothing
 
you
 
can
 
say
 
at
 
the
 
buzzword
 
level
 
that’s
 
dramatically
 
diﬀerent
 
from
 
what
 
our
 
competitors
 
are
 
saying
 
about
 
their
 
product,
 
service,
 
or
 
company.
 
The
 
elevator
 
pitch,
 
therefore,
 
tends
 
to
 
be
 
counterproductive
 
to
 
your
 
selling
 
eﬀorts
 
because
 
it
 
commoditizes
 
your
 
value
 
proposition
 
and
 
you
 
will
 
ultimately
 
sound
 
just
 
like
 
everyone
 
else.
 
Your
 
power
 
is
 
in
 
your
 
authenticity!
  Truthfully,  parents/guardians  and  children  will  experience  the  beneﬁts  of  Scholars  and  that  will  be  great  
for
 
retention,
 
but
 
without
 
your
 
initial
 
conversation
 
skills,
 
Scholars’
 
greatness
 
on
 
its
 
own
 
will
 
not
 
get
 
them
 
in
 
the
 
door.
 
You
 
need
 
to
 
hear
 
the
 
problems
,
 
bring
 
to
 
light
 
the
 
alternatives
,
 
and
 
then
 
oﬀer
 
the
 
solutions
.
  Problems  →  Alternatives  →  Solutions  is  how  Scholars  families  make  purchase  decisions.  Bond  with  the  
customer
 
on
 
their
 
problems,
 
not
 
your
 
solutions.
 
Then
 
ask
 
questions
 
that
 
build
 
on
 
the
 
value
 
of
 
our
 
oﬀering.
 
To
 
fully
 
cement
 
this
 
concept,
 
ask
 
yourself
 
this
 
question:
 
what's
 
more
 
important
 
to
 
your
 
parents/guardians:
 
their
 
problems,
 
issues,
 
concerns,
 
goals,
 
and
 
objectives
 
for
 
their
 
child,
 
or
 
hearing
 
an
 
elevator
 
pitch
 
from
 
a
 
tutoring
 
company?

Chapter  2:  Sales    The  more  reasons  we  give  the  parent/guardian  to  come  to  Scholars,  the  more  motivated  and  urgent  the  
decision
 
is.
 
Give
 
them
 
lots
 
of
 
reasons
 
to
 
pick
 
Scholars.
 
Many
 
people
 
tutor,
 
so
 
use
 
ten
 
implications
 
to
 
the
 
competitor’s
 
one,
 
and
 
we
 
win
 
the
 
business
 
every
 
time!
  From  reviewing  CallRail  recordings,  we  want  to  alert  you  to  common  mistakes  that  new  locations  make:  ●  Relying  on  customers  to  determine  the  root  issue(s).  You  need  to  guide  this  conversation,  which  
turns
 
into
 
reasons
 
to
 
enroll
 
in
 
Scholars
 
today.
 ●  Every  Scholars’  location  starts  with  zero  students.  Do  not  rush  to  hand  out  deals  to  get  people  in  
the
 
door.
 
If
 
they
 
are
 
only
 
enrolling
 
because
 
they
 
received
 
a
 
discount,
 
then
 
these
 
clients
 
are
 
likely
 
to
 
remain
 
a
 
thorn
 
in
 
your
 
side
 
for
 
as
 
long
 
as
 
they
 
are
 
enrolled.
 ●  Be  a  problem  solver,  but  make  sure  you  have  followed  the  process  and  have  discovered  their  
unique
 
and
 
speciﬁc
 
problems.
 
  What  do  you  think  is  a  better  way  to  start  a  call:  1.  “ Tell  me  more  about  what  your  child  is  experiencing  at  school  so  I  can  share  how  Scholars  can  
help.
”
 2.  “ What  is  your  schedule  like  this  week? ”   You’d  be  surprised  how  many  people  ask  for  a  phone  number  or  email  address  before  asking  the  ﬁrst  
question
 
above.
 
Many
 
people
 
never
 
ask
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
question
 
(or
 
something
 
similar)
 
at
 
all.
 
If
 
you
 
do,
 
the
 
parent/guardian
 
will
 
give
 
you
 
a
 
list
 
of
 
reasons
 
why
 
they
 
need
 
to
 
attend
 
Scholars
 
that
 
you
 
will
 
remind
 
them
 
of
 
when
 
it’s
 
time
 
to
 
schedule
 
them
 
for
 
their
 
complimentary
 
assessment
 
or
 
trial
 
hour.
 
For
 
each
 
issue
 
they
 
raise,
 
the
 
objective
 
is
 
to
 
expand
 
each
 
issue
 
so
 
they
 
feel
 
a
 
greater
 
sense
 
of
 
urgency
 
to
 
move
 
forward
 
and
 
enroll.
 
If
 
you
 
are
 
perceived
 
as
 
a
 
truly
 
valuable
 
resource,
 
prospective
 
clients
 
will
 
want
 
to
 
talk
 
with
 
you
 
about
 
their
 
issues,
 
problems,
 
and
 
concerns
 
-
 
because
 
they
 
want
 
valuable
 
recommendations
 
and
 
solutions.
  People  love  to  talk  about  themselves  and  issues  that  are  important  to  them.  Using  these  techniques,  you  
can
 
help
 
potential
 
clients
 
satisfy
 
their
 
own
 
needs
 
by
 
engaging
 
them
 
in
 
more
 
productive
 
conversations.
  Greater  needs  increase  the  sense  of  urgency.  Emphasize  the  importance  of  rectifying  the  problem.  Allow  
people
 
to
 
explain
 
the
 
misery
 
of
 
the
 
problem.
 
Don’t
 
just
 
jump
 
in
 
and
 
ﬁx
 
it.
 
This  is  being  customer-centric  vs.  self-serving,  as  we  listen  to  the  problem  ﬁrst.  
While  we  have  gone  through  a  few  pages  of  ideas  here,  at  the  end  of  the  day,  there  are  three  words  you  
need
 
to
 
know
 
when
 
working
 
through
 
the
 
inquiry
 
to
 
the
 
enrollment
 
process.
 
The
 
same
 
three
 
words
 
that
 
will
 
determine
 
your
 
success:
 
 
competence             credibility             value

Chapter  2:  Sales    
Psychology  of  Pricing  
People  tend  to  spend  more  when  it  is  important.  What  is  more  important  than  a  child’s  future  to  a  
parent/guardian?
 
Nothing.
 
For
 
this
 
reason,
 
discounts
 
and
 
deals
 
cheapen
 
our
 
oﬀering
.
 
Sure,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
time
 
and
 
a
 
place
 
for
 
rewarding
 
loyalty
 
and
 
understanding
 
the
 
investment
 
involved
 
if
 
one
 
family
 
is
 
sending
 
three
 
of
 
their
 
children
 
to
 
your
 
location.
 
However,
 
keep
 
in
 
mind
 
that
 
news
 
travels
 
fast
 
and
 
soon
 
enough,
 
everyone
 
in
 
your
 
location
 
will
 
know
 
who
 
is
 
paying
 
the
 
lowest
 
and
 
will
 
come
 
to
 
you
 
requesting
 
a
 
discounted
 
rate
 
since
 
they
 
heard
 
someone
 
else
 
is
 
getting
 
that
 
rate.
 
  With  the  involvement  you  will  have  in  your  community,  we  want  parents/guardians  talking  about  us,  just  
not
 
to
 
compare
 
their
 
monthly
 
fees.
 
If
 
you
 
are
 
oﬀering
 
discounts
 
to
 
get
 
people
 
in
 
the
 
door,
 
then
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
do
 
a
 
better
 
job
 
of
 
understanding
 
our
 
program
 
and
 
solution,
 
and
 
explaining
 
its
 
beneﬁts
 
to
 
increase
 
the
 
value
 
by
 
the
 
parent/guardian.
 
If
 
you
 
know
 
this
 
chapter
 
front
 
to
 
back,
 
many
 
parents/guardians
 
will
 
not
 
even
 
ask
 
the
 
cost
 
as
 
you
 
have
 
demonstrated
 
the
 
immense
 
value
 
we
 
will
 
add
 
to
 
their
 
family’s
 
life.
 
  Best  Practices :   ●  We  suggest  ending  the  conversation  with  your  price  so  there  are  no  surprises  and  using  an  even  
number.
 
 ○  No  pennies,  and  deﬁnitely  not  ending  in  “.99”.  They  are  not  buying  a  used  car  here,  and  
this
 
approach
 
cheapens
 
our
 
oﬀering
 
and
 
you
 
will
 
come
 
oﬀ
 
as
 
a
 
tacky
 
salesperson.
 
 ●  Based  on  our  experience,  when  a  location  has  a  low  closing  percentage,  their  ﬁrst  reaction  is,  “I  
need
 
to
 
lower
 
my
 
price”.
 
 ○  This  is  incorrect.  You  simply  need  to  reﬂect  on  how  you  can  communicate  our  oﬀering  in  
the
 
best
 
way
 
for
 
families
 
in
 
your
 
community.
 
From
 
speaking
 
with
 
locations
 
who
 
charge
 
the
 
highest
 
rates
 
in
 
our
 
system,
 
you
 
will
 
ﬁnd
 
that
 
often
 
their
 
parents/guardians
 
do
 
not
 
even
 
ask
 
the
 
price
 
as
 
they
 
know
 
the
 
Scholars
 
Solution
 
is
 
one
 
that
 
their
 
child
 
cannot
 
live
 
without.
 
 ○  Monitor  your  success  rate  using  your  KPIs  in  IQ,  particularly  your  closing  percentage.  The  
lower
 
it
 
sits,
 
the
 
more
 
opportunity
 
there
 
is
 
for
 
improvement.
 
  At  Scholars,  we  are  the  best  at  what  we  do.  We  are  a  premium  oﬀering  and  people  expect  to  pay  a  
premium
 
price.
 
Never
 
do
 
yourself,
 
or
 
the
 
brand,
 
a
 
disservice
 
by
 
oﬀering
 
discounted
 
rates
 
simply
 
because
 
you
 
do
 
not
 
take
 
the
 
time
 
to
 
engage
 
with
 
the
 
parent/guardian
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
their
 
problems
 
before
 
moving
 
on
 
to
 
the
 
Scholars
 
Solution

Chapter  3:  Marketing  &  Community  Connections    
Local  Marketing  
Local  marketing  is  an  essential  component  of  Scholars  Must-Have  Systems:  The  Marketing  Machine.  The  
Marketing
 
Machine
 
functions
 
with
 
maximum
 
eﬃciency
 
when
 
it
 
receives
 
all
 
the
 
necessary
 
parts
 
and
 
services
 
to
 
operate
 
smoothly.
  Your  Scholars  marketing  combines  digital  marketing  —  run  through  Scholars  Head  Oﬃce  and  managed  
by
 
Northern
 
—
 
with
 
traditional
 
and
 
community
 
marketing
 
initiatives.
 
Neither
 
piece
 
can
 
operate
 
alone.
  The  following  local  marketing  initiatives  are  a  shortlist  of  best  practices  to  serve  as  a  reference  guide  
when
 
building
 
your
 
quarterly
 
local
 
marketing
 
plan.
 
The
 
rhythm
 
and
 
frequency
 
of
 
your
 
location’s
 
local
 
marketing
 
eﬀorts
 
will
 
certainly
 
dovetail
 
with
 
the
 
seasonality
 
of
 
the
 
school
 
year
 
calendar
 
and
 
the
 
annual
 
community
 
events
 
calendar.
  
Local  Marketing  Investment  Every  location  shall  invest  the  greater  of  5%  of  gross  revenue  or  $15  000  in  local  marketing  per  year  as  
per
 
their
 
Franchise
 
Agreement.
 
  $753.99  per  month  is  pre-allocated  for  Scholars  digital  marketing  program,  leaving  a  minimum  of

Brand  Pillars  
Understanding  our  brand  is  essential  to  creating  marketing  collateral  that  is  both  valuable  and  eﬀective  
in
 
connecting
 
with
 
your
 
local
 
audience.
 
In
 
a
 
franchise
 
model
 
like
 
ours
 
—
 
where
 
each
 
location
 
operates
 
independently
 
but
 
shares
 
a
 
common
 
identity
 
—
 
brand
 
consistency
 
is
 
even
 
more
 
critical.
 
At  Scholars,  we  are  stronger  together.

Chapter  3:  Marketing  &  Community  Connections    This  principle  applies  not  only  to  our  marketing  and  social  media  eﬀorts  but  also  to  our  programming,  
customer
 
experience,
 
and
 
even
 
the
 
layout
 
of
 
our
 
spaces.
 
Clear
 
and
 
consistent
 
cohesion
 
across
 
the
 
system
 
reinforces
 
credibility,
 
professionalism,
 
and

Our   Purpose  
●  Scholars  fosters  lifelong  growth  in  academics,  self-conﬁdence,  and  self-esteem  for  all  students..   ●  Our  personalized  tutoring  services  provide  students  with  the  support  they  often  can’t  ﬁnd  in  traditional  classrooms ,  which  builds  genuine  conﬁdence  and  measurable  results.   ●  What  keeps  us  committed  is  seeing  students  unlock  their  full  potential .  
Our   Position  
●  Scholars  is  a  premium  supplemental  education  company  that  creates  results  that  matter  for  students  inside  and  outside  of  the  classroom  through  personalized  programming .   ●  Scholars  claims  the  space  where  academic  results  meet  individualized,  relationship-driven  support .   ●  Unlike  mass-market  tutoring  services,  we  oﬀer  customized  learning  plans  taught  by  caring  teachers,  ensuring  students  not  only  improve  their  grades  but  also  build  lasting  conﬁdence,  skills,  strategies,  and  habits .   ●  Our  competitive  edge  lies  in  measurable  outcomes  backed  by  genuine  care,  our  Enrich,  Enhance,  Extend  pedagogy,  and  regular  communication  with  parents/guardians  and  classroom  teachers.  
Our  Personality  
●  If  Scholars  were  a  person,  we’d  be  the  encouraging,  knowledgeable  mentor :  warm,  approachable,  and  deeply  invested  in  each  student’s  success.   ●  We  speak  with  clarity  and  conﬁdence,  striking  a  balance  between  professionalism  and  genuine  care,  always  aiming  to  make  families  feel  supported  and  empowered .   ●  Our  style  is  clean,  modern,  and  inviting ,  reﬂecting  our  belief  that  learning  should  be  both  purposeful  and  positive.

Chapter  3:  Marketing  &  Community  Connections    
Our  Perception  
●  When  we’re  not  in  the  room,  parents/guardians  and  students  will  describe  Scholars  as  reliable,  results-driven,  and  genuinely  caring.   ●  Families  see  us  as  a  trusted  partner  in  their  child’s  academic  journey,  delivering  real  progress.   ●  The  impression  we  leave  is  that  we  go  beyond  tutoring ;  we  build  conﬁdence,  consistency,  and  connection  with  our  students  and  the  community.

timeline:
  ●  What  is  the  goal/purpose  of  your  marketing?  ●  What  is  the  cost/beneﬁt  of  each  medium?  ●  Is  it  direct  or  indirect  marketing?  ●  Is  it  active  or  passive  marketing?

 Additional  Signage  
Aside  from  your  unit  signage,  an  additional  form  of  signage,  displayed  every  quarter,  has  been  proven  to  
drive
 
awareness
 
of
 
who
 
we
 
are
 
and
 
what
 
we
 
oﬀer.
 
The
 
additional
 
signage
 
also
 
provides
 
an
 
opportunity
 
to
 
promote
 
your
 
name
 
in
 
other
 
areas
 
of
 
your
 
community.
 
 
●  Sandwich  Boards  ●  Roadside  Signs  (Curbex  or  other)  ●  Digital  Boards  (Out  of  Home)  -  i.e.  community  centre,  mall/plaza  signage  ●  Community  Buildings:  banners,  arena  boards,  etc.   
●  Outdoor  Benches  and  Shelters  ●  Buses  ●  Billboards  ●  Car  wraps  
 The  two  most  popular  choices  for  locations  system-wide  are  sandwich  boards  and  roadside  signs  as  
additional
 
signage.
 
Here
 
are
 
the
 
steps
 
to
 
acquire
 
these
 
pieces:
 
Sandwich  Board:  
 Verify  with  your  landlord/property  manager  that  you  are  able  to   have  a  sandwich  board  on  your  sidewalk,  and  if  there  are  any  restrictions.   Purchase  your  sandwich  board.

Chapter  3:  Marketing  &  Community  Connections     TIP:  The  WindPro  Heavy  Duty  Snap  Edge  Sign  -  24”  x  36”  -  Black from  ULINE  is  highly  recommended  for  its  durability  and  low  poster  cost.  With  other  
non-weatherproof
 
sandwich
 
boards,
 
you
 
may
 
save
 
on
 
the
 
initial
 
unit,
 
but
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
greater
 
expense
 
for
 
plasticore
 
material
 
for
 
the
 
poster
 
itself
 
rather
 
than
 
traditional
 
poster
 
paper.
  Submit  a  Marketing  Request  Form with  your  poster  dimensions,  selected  image,  header  1,  and  header  2.    TIP:  Remember,  seasonal  messaging  every  quarter  works  best!  To  determine  which  messages  are  most  
relevant
 
to
 
the
 
season,
 
refer
 
to
 
the
 
Marketing
 
Guide
 
Codes
 
in
 
the
 
seasonality
 
chart
 
above.
 
Though
 
template
 
designs
 
are
 
available
 
in
 
the
 
Marketing
 
Request
 
Form,
 
feel
 
free
 
to
 
request
 
additional
 
customization
 
as
 
required.
  Send  the  production-ready  location-speciﬁc  print  collateral  you  received  from  the  Scholars  Marketing  Team  to  a  print  vendor  of  choice:  local  print  vendor,  Staples  Print  Shop,  VistaPrint,  etc.    Install  the  poster  into  your  sandwich  board  and  have  it  outside  your  location  for  the  entire  time  you  are  open.  
Roadside  Sign:  
 Verify  with  your  landlord/property  manager  that  you  are  able  to  have  a  roadside  sign  on  a  grassy  roadside  portion  of  the  plaza’s  property.  Conﬁrm  if  there  are  any  restrictions  -  i.e.  length  of  time,  
location,
 
etc.
  Source  a  local  vendor  for  the  roadside  sign.  Most  vendors  will  oﬀer  assistance  on  location  strategy  and  municipal  permitting  (if  applicable).   While  there  are  many  types  of  roadside  signs,  a  mini-billboard  style,  like  those  oﬀered  by  companies  like  Curbex,  have  been  proven  to  have  the  greatest  impact  and  ROI  compared  to  magnetic/slide  letter  signs  or  lawn  signs,  which  portray  a  lower-value  oﬀering  that  falls  
out
 
of
 
line
 
with
 
our
 
premium
 
product.
  Submit  a  Marketing  Request  with  the  roadside  sign  dimensions  from  your  selected  vendor.  Choose  your  image  and  headers.   TIP:  Remember,  seasonal  messaging  every  quarter  works  best!  To  determine  which  messages  are  most  relevant  to  the  season,  refer  to  the  Marketing  Guide  Codes  in  the  
seasonality
 
chart

Chapter  3:  Marketing  &  Community  Connections     Send  the  production-ready  location-speciﬁc  collateral  you  received  from  the  Marketing  Team  to  your  selected  signage  vendor.  The  vendor  will  then  handle  the  printing  and  installation  in-house  
and
 
deliver
 
the
 
signage
 
to
 
the
 
selected
 
area
 
in
 
your
 
plaza.
 
 
“Print”  Collateral  
This  category  works  in  tandem  with  your  other  “buckets”  to  get  multiple  visibility  points  within  your  
community.
 
Rather
 
than
 
the
 
traditional
 
“print”
 
of
 
newspaper
 
ads,
 
consider
 
other
 
ways
 
to
 
get
 
your
 
name
 
and
 
product
 
oﬀering
 
into
 
your
 
community.
 
  Collateral,  such  as  postcards,  door  hangers,  “feature  speaker”  newspaper/magazine  articles,  library  
bookmarks,
 
and
 
the
 
like,
 
is
 
a
 
great
 
way
 
to
 
complement
 
your
 
other
 
local
 
marketing
 
eﬀorts.
 
The  most  popular  choice  for  locations  system-wide  is  direct  mail  campaigns  using  our  branded  postcard  
templates.
 
Here
 
are
 
the
 
steps
 
to
 
execute
 
this
 
campaign:
 
 DRMG is  a  preferred  vendor  that  Scholars  has  used  multiple  times  for  direct  mailpostcard  campaigns.    DRMG  works  with  locations  to  select  preferred  demographics  in  your  territory  (e.g.  family  size,  household  income,  etc.).  The  company  then  handles  the  printing  in-house  and  
distribution
 
via
 
Canada
 
Post
 
outlets.
 
  Alternatively,  you  can  select  a  separate  print  vendor  for  the  postcards  and  then  handle  the  demographic  and  order  work  with  Canada  Post  directly,  but  an  all-in-one  solution  like  
DRMG
 
is
 
the
 
most
 
eﬃcient.

Chapter  3:  Marketing  &  Community  Connections     Submit  a  Marketing  Request  Form with  your  postcard  dimensions  and  any  other  print  requirements  from  your  selected  vendor.  Though  postcard  templates  are  available  on  the  
Marketing
 
Request
 
Form,
 
feel
 
free
 
to
 
request
 
additional
 
customization
 
as
 
required.
  TIP:  Remember,  seasonal  messaging  every  quarter  works  best!    TIP:  The  5”  x  11”  postcard  size  is  a  great  choice  because  it  stands  out  and  is  viewed  as  a  modern  and  premium  collateral  size.  The  Pathway  Postcard  (shown  below  and  available  in  
the
 
Marketing
 
Request
 
Form)
 
is
 
a
 
very
 
popular
 
choice
 
as
 
it
 
summarizes
 
the
 
middle
 
insert
 
of
 
the
 
Parent
 
Guide
 
in
 
a
 
simple
 
and
 
engaging
 
way.
 
 
 
“Active”  Community  Events  
These  in-person  events  in  your  community  help  drive  brand  recognition  and  build  partnerships.  They  are  
also
 
the
 
perfect
 
way
 
to
 
be
 
seen
 
as
 
a
 
brand
 
ambassador
 
and
 
a
 
trustworthy
 
resource
 
for
 
education
 
in
 
your
 
community.
 
  Some  events  to  consider:  
●  Community  Fairs  and  Festivals:  Participate  in  events  such  as  RibFests,  local  fairs,  street  fairs  and  
extra-curricular

for
 
the
 
community
 
 ●  Business  Networking  Groups:  Engage  with  the  Chamber  of  Commerce,  BIA,  and  other  
professional
 
groups

etc.
 
 
The  most  popular  choices  for  locations  system-wide  are  fairs  and  festivals.  
Here
 
are
 
the
 
steps:
 
 Research  available  events  on  your  neighbourhood  community  websites,  social  media  pages,  and  business  association  pages.   Fill  in  the  required  registration  form  and  submit  payment  (if  required).   Many  events  like  this  will  require  you  to  provide  them  with  proof  of  insurance  to  attend.  Additionally,  the  organizing  
committee/township/etc.
 
may
 
require
 
themselves
 
to
 
be
 
added
 
as
 
an
 
additional
 
insured.
 
If
 
this
 
is
 
required,
 
submit
 
a
 
Help
 
Desk
 
Ticket
 
requesting
 
an
 
amended
 
Certiﬁcate
 
of
 
Insurance.

are
 
a
 
perfect
 
ﬁt!

can
 
jump
 
at
 
a
 
last-minute
 
in-person
 
event.
  Send  the  production-ready  location-speciﬁc  print  collateral  
you
 
received
 
from

choice:
 
local

 vendor,  Staples  Print  Shop,  VistaPrint,  etc.    The  Draw:  exciting  activity   Coordinate  something  that  draws  prospects  to  your  table  -  think  
balloons,
 
face-painting,
 
popcorn,
 
yard
 
games,
 
spin-the-wheel,
 
etc.
 
By
 
drawing
 
students
 
(and

Chapter  3:  Marketing  &  Community  Connections    Community  Connections   In  today's  socially  conscious  environment,  employees  and  customers  place  a  premium  on  working  for  
and
 
spending
 
their
 
money
 
with
 
businesses
 
that
 
prioritize
 
corporate
 
social
 
responsibility.
 
It
 
is
 
imperative
 
as
 
a
 
business
 
owner
 
to
 
be
 
actively
 
involved
 
within
 
your
 
community
 
and
 
to
 
give
 
back.
 
The
 
initiatives
 
you
 
choose
 
to
 
participate
 
in
 
must
 
align
 
with
 
yours
 
and
 
the
 
location's
 
core
 
values.
 
Similar
 
to
 
“active”
 
community
 
events,
 
community
 
connections
 
demonstrate
 
your
 
interest
 
and
 
direct
 
involvement
 
in
 
and
 
support
 
of
 
student-based
 
activities
 
and
 
needs
 
in
 
your
 
community.
 
 
●  Sports  Teams:  Sponsor  local  sports  teams,  not  only  as  an  investment  in  the  community  but  also  
as
 
a
 
way
 
to
 
connect
 
with
 
current
 
and
 
potential
 
clients.
 
 ○  TIP:  Submit  a  Marketing  Request  Form  to  receive  a  personalized  ﬁle  so  you  can  add  the  
Scholars
 
logo
 
on
 
the
 
back
 
of
 
the
 
jersey.
 ○  TIP:  Don’t  simply  make  a  passive  donation  -  get  involved!   ■  If  they  are  having  a  year-end  tournament,  plan  to  attend  and  ask  to  set  up  a  small  
table.
 
At
 
the
 
very
 
least,
 
order
 
some
 
branded
 
swag
 
-
 
like
 
water
 
bottles
 
from
 
a
 promotional  vendor  like  4imprint -  to  give  to  the  team.  ●  School  Clubs:  Establish  meaningful  connections  by  supporting  school  clubs  such  as  STEM,  
robotics
 
and
 
chess.
 
This
 
is
 
particularly
 
impactful
 
when
 
engaging
 
with
 
schools
 
where
 
we
 
aim
 
to
 
enhance
 
our
 
presence,
 
focusing
 
on
 
programs
 
that
 
naturally
 
align
 
with
 
the
 
Scholars
 
oﬀerings.
 ○  TIP:  Same  as  with  sports  teams,  ﬁnd  a  way  to  get  involved  further.  Do  they  have  a  ﬁnal  
competition
 
day?
 
Take
 
some
 
branded
 
swag
 
for
 
the
 
group
 
and
 
cheer
 
them
 
on!
 ●  Community  Action  Drives:  Take  part  in  drives  for  essential  items,  including  food,  books,  and  
back-to-school
 
backpacks.
 
During
 
the
 
holiday
 
season,
 
contribute
 
to
 
the
 
spirit
 
of
 
giving
 
during
 
the
 holidays  by  participating  in  initiatives  like  Toy  Mountain.  These  eﬀorts  go  beyond  monetary  donations,  emphasizing  your  commitment  to  the  well-being  of  the  community.   ○  TIP:  This  is  a  great  way  to  connect  with  other  local  businesses.  Team  up  with  the  manager  
of
 
your
 
closest
 
grocery
 
store
 
or
 
Walmart
 
and
 
ﬁnd
 
a
 
Saturday
 
to
 
set
 
up
 
outside
 
their
 
store
 
to
 
collect
 
donations.
 
 ●  Volunteer  Engagement:  Actively  volunteer  for  community  activities,  such  as  gift  wrapping,  
managing
 
drop-oﬀ
 
locations,
 
and
 
providing
 
distribution
 
support.
 
This
 
hands-on
 
involvement
 
demonstrates
 
our
 
dedication
 
to
 
positively
 
impacting
 
local
 
events.
 ○  TIP:  Be  sure  to  be  a  “walking  billboard”  at  these  events  by  wearing  some  of  your  
Scholars-branded
 
gear.
 
Additional  Local  Marketing  Opportunities  
There  may  occasionally  be  marketing  opportunities  that  do  not  explicitly  fall  within  the  4+1  marketing  
buckets,
 
but
 
that
 
does
 
not
 
mean
 
that
 
they
 
shouldn’t
 
be
 
considered
 
in
 
your
 
overall
 
local
 
marketing
 
plan!

Chapter  3:  Marketing  &  Community  Connections    These  initiatives  include,  but  are  not  limited  to:  personalized  radio  ads,  email  marketing,  referral  incentive  
programs,
 
etc.
 
  
Social  Media  
Your  social  media  presence  is  an  ongoing  commitment  to  connecting  with  your  local  community  through  
Instagram
 
and
 
Facebook
 
in
 
a
 
way
 
that
 
complements
 
and
 
reinforces
 
the
 
other
 
four
 
marketing
 
buckets
 
at
 
all
 
times
 
of
 
the
 
year.
 
As
 
a
 
Scholars
 
franchised
 
location,
 
your
 
role
 
in
 
building
 
and
 
maintaining
 
your
 
location’s
 
online
 
presence
 
is
 
just
 
as
 
important
 
as
 
ours
 
at
 
Head
 
Oﬃce.
 
While
 
we
 
work
 
together
 
toward
 
shared
 
goals,
 
it's
 
essential
 
to
 
understand
 
how
 
our
 
responsibilities
 
complement
 
one
 
another.
 
Here’s  how  we  divide  the  work:  
●  Head  Oﬃce:  We  create  system-wide  content  designed  to  keep  your  channels  active  and  
maintain
 
consistent
 
visibility.
 
These
 
posts
 
are
 
announced
 
in
 
advance
 
in
 
The
 
Scoop
,
 
allowing
 
you
 
to
 
plan
 
and
 
align
 
your
 
local
 
content
 
accordingly.
 ●  Each  Scholars  Location:  You  are  responsible  for  generating  localized  content  that  reﬂects  your  
unique
 
presence
 
in
 
the
 
community.
 
This
 
authentic,
 
community-driven
 
content
 
helps
 
build
 
trust
 
and
 
relevance
 
at
 
the
 
local
 
level.
 
Posting  Goal:  Aim  for  one  post  per  day ,  combining  both  Head  Oﬃce  content  and  your  own  local  
contributions
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
dynamic,
 
engaging
 
feed.
 
 
Content  Strategy   Instagram  and  Facebook  are  key  tools  for  community  building.  On  social  media,  you  can  accumulate  
interest
 
from
 
new
 
leads
 
and
 
build
 
loyalty
 
in
 
current
 
students
 
by
 
showing
 
them
 
the
 
value
 
of
 
our
 
services,
 
getting
 
them
 
excited
 
about
 
upcoming
 
events,
 
and
 
providing
 
them
 
with
 
a
 
“peek
 
behind
 
the
 
curtain”
 
at
 
the
 
experience
 
of
 
the
 
Scholars
 
classroom.
 
In  addition  to  our  brand  pillars,  every  location  should  be  guided  by  our  social  media  content  pillars  —  
four
 
overarching
 
themes
 
that
 
give
 
your
 
social
 
media
 
strategy
 
both
 
structure
 
and
 
intention.
 
These
 
pillars
 
ensure
 
that
 
our
 
content
 
stays
 
consistent,
 
engaging,
 
and
 
aligned
 
with
 
both
 
our
 
business
 
goals
 
and
 
our
 
audience’s
 
interests.
 
The  optimal  framework  includes:  
●  Two  sales-focused  pillars  to  highlight  programs,  promotions,  and  drive  conversions  ●  Two  community-building  pillars  to  create  connection,  build  trust,  and  humanize  your  brand

Chapter  3:  Marketing  &  Community  Connections    Using  content  pillars  alongside  our  core  brand  pillars  is  essential  for  planning  content  in  advance,  staying  
on
 
message,
 
and
 
creating
 
a
 
well-balanced
 
feed
 
that
 
serves
 
both
 
your
 
business
 
and
 
your
 
audience.
 
Keep  in  mind  that  not  all  content  will  ﬁt  neatly  into  a  single  content  pillar  —  many  posts  will  naturally  
overlap
 
categories,
 
and
 
that’s
 
okay!
 
The
 
key
 
is
 
to
 
maintain
 
a
 
healthy
 
balance
 
between
 
sales-driven
 
content
 
and
 
community-building
 
content.
 
 
If  your  feed  is  overly  focused  on  promotions,  it  can  start  to  feel  transactional.  Your  goal  is  to  create  a  
social
 
presence
 
that
 
your
 
audience
 
genuinely
 
wants
 
to
 
follow
 
—
 
because
 
the
 
content
 
is
 
engaging,
 
informative,
 
and
 
relevant
 
to
 
their
 
needs.
 
When
 
your
 
posts
 
consistently
 
oﬀer
 
value,
 
trust
 
grows—and
 
so
 
does
 
the
 
likelihood
 
of
 
meaningful
 
conversions.
 
Content  Pillars   
Sales  Focused  
Convince  
●  “Hard  sales”  ○  Showcasing  our  services,  text-based  calls  to  action,  and  direct  sales  content  ○  The  most  straightforward  content  to  create,  focused  purely  on  conversions,  designed  to  anticipate  and  overcome  objections  
Excite  
●  “Soft  sales”  ○  Location  updates,  collaborations,  upcoming  events,  awards,  and  exciting  announcements  ○  Brand-centred  but  not  explicitly  pushing  sales  
Community  Building  
Relate  
●  Relatable  or  entertaining  content  aimed  at  building  community  through  common  experiences.   
Educate  
●  Value-driven  educational  content  aimed  at  building  credibility  and  brand  authority  (e.g.,  related  to  education,  school,  accessibility,  study  habits,  etc.)  .

comes
 
to
 
spelling

grammar;
 
therefore,
 
it
 
must
 
be
 
perfect!
 
 ○  Use  a  browser  extension  like  Grammarly  to  double-check  your  writing!   ○  This  extends  to  student  work  as  well  (e.g.  Scholars  Apples  and  lobby  campaigns)  ●  Hashtags  aren’t  needed!  If  any,  use  minimal  hashtags  (maximum  of  three)  ●  Ensure  posts  are  sized  correctly  for  the  platform;  see  the  Social  Media  Dimensions  Guide  below  ●  Do  not  post  any  proprietary  content  (e.g.  curriculum  documents  or  assessment  materials)  ●  Do  not  use  any  Scholars  logos  on  posts  that  have  not  been  submitted  through  the  Marketing  
Request
 
Form
 ●  Ensure  all  featured  students  have  signed  the  Media  Release  (in  the  Enrollment  Form  and  all

Chapter  3:  Marketing  &  Community  Connections    Social  Media  Dimensions  Guide   Are  you  unsure  about  the  best  dimensions  for  Instagram  posts,  reels,  Facebook  videos,  or  stories?  This  
quick
 
guide
 
breaks
 
down
 
the
 
latest
 
sizing
 
best
 
practices
 
so
 
your
 
local
 
content
 
looks
 
polished
 
and
 
professional.
   Instagram  Proﬁle  Grid  ●  Current  trend:  Instagram  is  prioritizing  vertical  images,  both  in  reels  and  in  the  feed.  ●  Proﬁle  grid:  Instagram's  proﬁle  grid  now  displays  posts  in  a  4:5  aspect  ratio,  making  vertical  
images
 
more
 
prominent.
 ●  Recommended  size:  1080x1350  pixels  (4:5  aspect  ratio)   Reels  and  Stories  ●  Recommended  size:  1080  x  1920  pixels  (9:16  aspect  ratio)  ●  TIP:  Keep  key  elements  (text/logos)  vertically  centred  to  avoid  being  cut  oﬀ  by  the  user  interface!   Facebook  Feed  Posts  ●  Square  format:  Facebook's  feed  typically  displays  posts  in  a  square  format.  ●  Recommended  size:  Square  images  (1080x1080  pixels)  (1:1  aspect  ratio)   Videos  and  Stories  ●  Recommended  size:  1080  x  1920  pixels  (9:16  aspect  ratio)  ●  TIP:  Keep  key  elements  (text/logos)  vertically  centred  to  avoid  being  cut  oﬀ  by  the  user  interface!   In  summary,  by  requesting  both  a  vertical  (4:5)  and  a  square  (1:1)  version  of  your  graphics,  you're  
prepared
 
to
 
post
 
to
 
both
 
Instagram
 
and
 
Facebook,
 
ensuring
 
your
 
content
 
looks
 
great
 
on
 
both
 
platforms!
 
Templates
 
for
 
each
 
of
 
these
 
sizes
 
are

Request
 
Form.
  Editing:  Best  Practices   Images  ●  Use  the  Marketing  Request  Form to  request  your  design  if  a  logo  or  stock  photo  is  required.  ●  Refer  to  the  Social  Media:  Dimensions  Guide  above.  ●  Avoid  ﬁlters  and  unnecessary  text  overlays.  ●  Refer  to  th e  Marketing  Guide  for  additional  brand  guidelines  (e.g.,  brand  colours  and  fonts).

Chapter  3:  Marketing  &  Community  Connections    Videos  (Reels)  ●  The  hook:  Get  to  the  point  quickly!  ○  Rather  than  including  a  lengthy  pre-amble  to  your  videos,  keep  audience  attention  by  
diving
 
right
 
into
 
the
 
content.
 ●  Avoid  ﬁlters  and  transitions  ●  Write  in  sentence-case  ●  Balance  audio  with  music  ○  For  clarity,  avoid  music  unless  absolutely  necessary.  ●  Place  captions  in  the  middle  of  screen  to  avoid  the  user  interface  (UI);  white  captions  are  
preferred
 ●  Request  a  customized  end  screen  on  the  Marketing  Request  Form   Remember  that  everything  you  post  online  is  a  representation  of  you,  the  brand,  and  what  you  are  able  
to
 
oﬀer.

of
 
7”.
 
This
 
philosophy
 
is
 
tried
 
and
 
true
 
across
 
various
 
product
 
and
 
service
 
models,
 
and
 
suggests
 
that
 
consumers
 
need
 
to
 
see
 
an
 
ad
 
at
 
least
 
seven
 
times
 
before
 
they’re
 
ready
 
to
 
make
 
a
 
decision.
 
In
 
our
 
modern
 
world,
 
this
 
rule
 
is
 
less
 
about
 
“ads”
 
and
 
more
 
about
 
“touches”
 
and
 
impressions.
 
  These  impressions  are  diﬀerent  forms  of  interaction  that  your  audience  encounters  across  several  
diﬀerent
 
avenues.
 
They’re
 
not
 
necessarily
 
the
 
same
 
every
 
single
 
time,
 
but
 
rather
 
seven
 
similar
 
messages
 
and
 
interactions.
 
After
 
seven
 
“touches,”
 
prospects
 
likely
 
have
 
enough
 
information
 
to
 
be
 
ready
 
to
 
inquire
 
about
 
our
 
service.
 
We
 
have
 
seen
 
time
 
and
 
time
 
again
 
that
 
the
 
highest-quality
 
touches
 
and
 
impressions
 
are
 
through
 
interactive
 
and
 
engaging
 
eﬀorts
 
in
 
the
 
community.
 
  1.  Repetition  is  key:    ○  Most  customers  will  not  be  ready  to  engage  and  inquire  with  you  after  a  single  “touch”  -  
or
 
even
 
two
 
or
 
three.
 
Therefore,
 
messaging
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
repeated
 
several
 
times.
 ○  In  a  world  ﬂooded  with  brand  messaging,  our  brand  is  just  one  of  the  many  voices  vying  
for
 
attention.
 
To
 
cut
 
through
 
the
 
noise
 
of
 
other
 
brands,
 
our
 
audience
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
told
 
the
 
same
 
story
 
repeatedly
 
since
 
humans
 
are
 
naturally
 
drawn
 
to
 
patterns.

Chapter  3:  Marketing  &  Community  Connections    2.  Keep  it  consistent:  ○  These  repeated  “touches”  aren’t  eﬀective  if  our  audience  can’t  identify  who  they  are  
coming
 
from
 
or
 
what
 
our
 
core
 
oﬀering
 
is.
 ○  As  part  of  a  franchise,  you  have  the  power  of  a  brand  with  25  years  of  providing  
excellence
 
in
 
education
 
to
 
thousands
 
of
 
families
 
behind
 
you
 
compared
 
to
 
Roger’s
 
Tutoring.
  
 ○  This  is  why  the  Marketing  Team  works  tirelessly  to  maintain  our  brand’s  identity  -  whether  
it
 
be
 
colours,
 
fonts,
 
imagery,
 
or
 
language
 
-
 
to
 
keep
 
telling
 
the
 
same
 
story
 
and
 
be
 
highly
 
recognizable
 
whether
 
you
 
are
 
in
 
a
 
well-developed
 
territory
 
or
 
a
 
new
 
market.
 
  3.  The  simpler,  the  better:      ○  Simple  messaging  is  not  only  easier  to  repeat—it’s  easier  for  our  audience  to  understand.  
Complicated
 
messaging
 
requires
 
our
 
audience
 
to
 
use
 
more
 
calories
 
to
 
process.
 
 ○  In  our  templates  and  taglines,  we  can  address  a  pain  point,  position  ourselves  as  a  
solution
 
to
 
that
 
pain,
 
and
 
provide
 
a
 
call
 
to
 
action.
 ○  By  the  time  a  customer  sees  our  messages  seven  times,  they  have  a  good  idea  of  our  
story
 
and
 
how
 
our
 
solution
 
connects
 
to
 
them.
 
  4.  Use  multiple  avenues:      ○  Getting  to  seven  “touches”  is  much  easier  than  it  used  to  be  with  the  diverse  avenues  
available
 
for
 
local
 
marketing.
 
Filling
 
each
 
“4+1”
 
bucket
 
at
 
least
 
once
 
every
 
quarter
 
allows
 
you
 
to
 
reach
 
the
 
same
 
audience
 
in
 
various
 
ways,
 
which
 
ampliﬁes
 
your
 
recognition
 
in
 
your
 
community.
  
  5.  Every  piece  doesn’t  need  to  be  “new”:  ○  When  well  into  the  “4+1”  strategy,  you  can  sometimes  feel  like  you  are  generating  “stale”  
content
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
repetition
 
of
 
images,
 
taglines,
 
and
 
messaging.
 
However,
 
it’s
 
important
 
to
 
remember
 
that
 
our
 
audience
 
views
 
our
 
content
 
diﬀerently
 
than
 
we
 
do.
 ○  We  are  “overexposed”  to  our  brand,  which  cannot  be  said  about  our  lead  prospects.  
When
 
deciding
 
on
 
the
 
content
 
for
 
your
 
marketing
 
initiatives,
 
continuing
 
with
 
the
 
same
 
batch
 
of
 
seasonal
 
messaging
 
throughout
 
each
 
piece
 
will
 
only
 
provide
 
consistency
 
and
 
repetition.
 
  6.  “7”  isn’t  set  in  stone:    ○  Unfortunately,  there  is  no  magical  guarantee  that  a  prospect  will  be  ready  to  engage  and  
inquire
 
after
 
seven
 
touches.
 
Some
 
customers
 
may
 
take
 
four,
 
and
 
others
 
may
 
take
 
sixteen
 
before
 
they
 
are
 
ready
 
to
 
become
 
customers.
 
 ○  The  importance  of  “The  Rule  of  7”  isn’t  the  number  itself  but  the  idea  of  repetition,  
consistency,
 
and
 
diversiﬁcation.

Chapter  3:  Marketing  &  Community  Connections    Our  audience  has  many  supplemental  education  brands  vying  for  their  attention  constantly.  When  you  
make
 
an
 
eﬀort
 
to
 
communicate
 
with
 
your
 
audience
 
in
 
a
 
way
 
that
 
addresses
 
their
 
needs
 
and
 
uses
 
clear
 
and
 
consistent
 
language,
 
you’ll
 
stand
 
out
 
from
 
all
 
the
 
noise.
 
You
 
will
 
gain
 
customers
 
if
 
you
 
know
 
your
 
audience,
 
communicate
 
with
 
them
 
clearly
 
and
 
repeatedly,
 
and
 
address
 
how
 
Scholars
 
can
 
meet
 
their
 
needs!
 
Marketing  Requests  &  Marketing  Guide  The  Scholars  Marketing  Team  is  here  to  support  your  marketing  eﬀorts  through  the  Marketing  Request  Form.  As  noted  in  every  location’s  Franchise  Agreement,  all  material  that  contains  the  Scholars  logo  must  be  created  and/or  approved  by  the  Marketing  Team.  To  ensure  brand  consistency  across  our  network,  
the
 
team
 
has
 
developed
 
a
 
handy
 
Marketing

This
 
guide
 
provides
 
photos,

templates,
 
best
 
practices,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
our
 
commitment
 
to
 
returning
 
your
 
collateral
 
promptly.
  Note:  When  submitting  your  requests  to  the  Marketing  Request  Form,  the  Marketing  Team  may  make  some  modiﬁcations  to  match  our  brand  standards  and  language.  For  example,  our  brand  language  is  
“Scholars
 
of
 
Location”
 
rather
 
than
 
“Location
 
Scholars”
 
and
 
we
 
choose
 
language
 
that
 
reﬂects
 
our
 
premium
 
brand,
 
such
 
as
 
“complimentary
 
assessment”
 
rather
 
than
 
“free
 
assessment.”
 
  
Community  &  School  Connections  
At  Scholars,  we  know  that  student  success  is  a  team  eﬀort.  By  fostering  strong  relationships  with  our  
community,
 
including
 
schools,
 
school
 
boards,
 
and
 
parent
 
councils,
 
we
 
create
 
a
 
supportive
 
learning
 
community
 
that
 
bridges
 
the
 
gap
 
between
 
in-school
 
and
 
out-of-school
 
learning
 
and
 
supports
 
the
 
“whole
 
child”.
 
These
 
connections
 
allow
 
us
 
to
 
better
 
understand
 
curriculum
 
expectations,
 
align
 
our
 
strategies,
 
and
 
advocate
 
for
 
the
 
needs
 
of
 
our
 
students.
 
One  of  the  best  ways  to  build  these  relationships  —  and  grow  our  presence  in  the  community  —  is  by  
sponsoring
 
or
 
participating
 
in
 
school
 
events
.
 
Whether
 
it’s
 
a
 
barbeque,
 
literacy
 
night,
 
career
 
fair,
 
fundraiser,
 
or
 
sports
 
tournament,
 
school
 
events
 
provide
 
valuable
 
opportunities
 
to
 
engage
 
directly
 
with
 
students,
 parents/guardians,  and  educators.  By  sponsoring,  donating,  or  volunteering,  we  not  only  show  
our
 
commitment
 
to
 
education
 
but
 
also
 
increase
 
brand
 
visibility
 
and
 
trust
 
among
 
families
 
and
 
school
 
staﬀ.
 
“Getting  In”  with  Schools  and  Parent  Councils   
Leverage  your  network  of  tutors,  parents/guardians,  friends,  and  colleagues  to  identify  and  connect  with  
schools
 
about
 
upcoming
 
sponsorship
 
and
 
donation
 
opportunities.
 
A
 
small
 
sponsorship
 
or
 
a
 
donated
 
prize
 
(e.g.,
 
three
 
complimentary
 
tutoring
 
sessions,
 
a
 
backpack
 
full
 
of
 
school
 
supplies,
 
etc.)
 
can

Chapter  3:  Marketing  &  Community  Connections    way  in  building  goodwill  and  positioning  us  as  a  go-to  resource  for  academic  support.  The  stronger  our  
presence
 
in
 
school
 
communities,
 
the
 
more
 
we
 
reinforce
 
our
 
reputation
 
as
 
an
 
integral
 
part
 
of
 
student
 
success.
 
Engage  with  school-aﬃliated  Facebook  groups  and  pages  where  PTAs  often  post  updates,  organize  
events,
 
and
 
welcome
 
community
 
partnerships.
 
Reaching
 
out
 
directly
 
to
 
school
 
staﬀ
 
through
 
Facebook,
 email,  LinkedIn ,  or  via  Team  Approach  Agreement conversations.  Attending  school  board  or  PTA  meetings  and  volunteering  at  events  are  also  great  ways  to  establish  relationships  that  can  lead  to  
long-term
 
collaboration.
 
Let’s  make  the  most  of  these  opportunities  and  continue  growing  our  impact  —  one  school  connection  at  
a
 
time!
 
Best  Practices   
Leverage  your  Network:  Find  your  “Entry  Badge”  
When  approaching  a  new  contact,  always  build  credibility  in  your  communication  with  schools  by  
describing
 
your
 
direct
 
connection
 
to
 
the
 
school
.
 
Sending
 
generic
 
emails
 
to
 
a
 
publicly-available
 
email
 
address
 
is
 
like
 
knocking
 
on
 
a
 
locked
 
door
 
without
 
a
 
key.
 
Think
 
of
 
your
 
connection
 
as
 
your
 
“entry
 
badge”
 
to
 
gain
 
you
 
access
 
to
 
the
 
next
 
stage
 
of
 
the
 
consideration
 
process.
 
Leverage:  
★  Tutors  ○  “One  of  my  incredible  teachers,  Miss  Abby,  often  works  as  an  Occasional  Teacher  at  your  
school“
 ★  Parents/Guardians   ○  “One  of  my  student’s  parents,  Megan  Smith,  brought  your  upcoming  book  fair  to  my  
attention.”
 ★  Metrics  ○  “There  are  10  students  from  your  school  who  are  currently  enrolled  at  Scholars  of  
Location
 
and
 
we’re
 
only
 
continuing
 
to
 
grow
 
each
 
day!”
 ★  Team  Approach  Agreement  ○  Use  your  touchpoints  with  the  Team  Approach  Agreement  to  build  rapport  with  local  
teachers.
 
 
TIP:
 
Although
 
the
 
purpose
 
of
 
these
 
meetings
 
is
 
to
 
gather
 
information
 
about
 
speciﬁc
 
student
 
needs,
 
communication
 
over
 
time
 
may
 
move
 
towards
 
involvement
 
in
 
school
 
events
 
and
 
fundraisers.

Chapter  3:  Marketing  &  Community  Connections    ★  Consider  your  FRANKS  List  
Messaging:  Giving  Back!  
Instead  of  cold-emailing  schools  with  promotional  oﬀers,  we  focus  on  giving  back  through  donations,  
sponsorships,
 
and
 
active
 
participation
 
in
 
school
 
events.
 
By
 
approaching
 
schools
 
with
 
the
 
mindset
 
of
 
contributing
,
 
we
 
build
 
trust
 
and
 
establish
 
ourselves
 
as
 
a
 
valued
 
partner
 
in
 
education
 
●  Emphasize:  ○  “Give  back  to  the  community”   ○  “Sponsorship,  donation,  and  event-participation  opportunities”  ●  Avoid:   ○  “Certiﬁed  vendor”  and  “marketing”  ●  The  more  speciﬁc,  the  better!  ○  If  you  are  aware  of  an  upcoming  community  event  or  fundraising  initiative,  call  it  out  by  
name
 
(e.g.,
 
Terry
 
Fox
 
Run,
 
book
 
fair,
 
fundraiser
 
for
 
new

Chapter  4:  Inquiries    
Inquiries  
How  do  you  convert  a  lead  to  an  enrollment?  Connect  with  parents/guardians  through  a  genuine  
conversation
 
and
 
show
 
that
 
we
 
truly
 
care
 
about
 
helping
 
their
 
child
 
reach
 
their
 
full
 
potential!
 
The
 
desired
 
result
 
of
 
this
 
initial
 
touchpoint
 
is
 
to
 
book
 
the
 
assessment,
 
benchmarking
 
session,
 
or
 
trial
 
hour.
  Every  lead  -  no  matter  the  source  -  should  be  treated  with  urgency.  In  today’s  modern  world,  it’s  
extremely
 
easy
 
for
 
parents/guardians
 
to
 
inquire
 
with
 
multiple
 
tutoring
 
companies
 
in
 
a
 
short
 
period
 
of
 
time,
 
especially
 
with
 
digital
 
lead
 
collections.
 
Therefore,
 
it’s
 
important
 
that
 
we
 
are
 
always
 
picking
 
up
 
the
 
phone
 
every
 
time
 
that
 
it
 
rings
 
and
 
responding
 
to
 
digital
 
inquiries
 
as
 
soon
 
as
 
they
 
enter
 
your
 
inbox.
 
  In  many  cases,  the  prospective  client  is  working  the  “Tutoring  Near  Me”  list  on  Google  and  calling  or  
submitting
 
digital
 
requests
 
to
 
the
 
entire
 
list.
 
If
 
you
 
miss
 
picking
 
up
 
the
 
phone
 
or
 
responding
 
to
 
an
 
email
 
in
 
a
 
timely
 
manner,
 
you’ve
 
given
 
your
 
competitors
 
the
 
opportunity
 
to
 
scoop
 
up
 
the
 
lead
 
for
 
themselves.
 
  TIP:  Whenever  the  phone  rings  or  your  inbox  pings,  think  of  it  as  a  $2  500  cheque  you  don’t  want  to  
miss!
 
(This
 
is
 
based
 
on
 
a
 
conservative
 
estimate
 
of
 
a
 
client
 
enrolling
 
for
 
six
 
months
 
of
 
sessions
 
at
 
a
 
minimum
 
of
 
eight
 
one-hour
 
sessions
 
a
 
month
 
at
 
a
 
rate
 
of
 
$50
 
per
 
hour.)
  
Individualized  Inquiries  Every  inquiry  is  unique;  there  is  no  “one  approach  ﬁts  all”  and  no  “one  pitch  or  spiel  convinces  all”.  As  
you
 
read
 
in
 
Chapter
 
2:
 
Sales,
 
a
 
question-based
 
approach
 
that
 
aims
 
to
 
listen
 
to
 
the
 
problems
,
 
understand
 
the
 
alternatives
,
 
and
 
oﬀer
 
the
 
Scholars
 
Solution
 
is
 
the
 
only
 
method
 
that
 
builds
 
competence
,
 
credibility
,
 
and
 
value
 
between
 
you
 
and
 
prospective
 
clients.
 
As
 
a
 
general
 
rule
 
of
 
thumb,
 
you
 
want
 
the
 
client
 
to
 
be
 
doing
 
about
 
75%
 
of
 
the
 
communicating
 
and
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
remain
 
an
 
active
 
and
 
engaged
 
listener
 
throughout.
  
Types  of  Inquiries  There  are  four  primary  sources  of  inquiries:   ●  phone  call  (e.g.,  to  the  location’s  phone  number  or  ﬁelded  through  the  toll  free  central  line);  ●  in-person  (“walk-ins”  or  while  out  in  the  community);  ●  email ;  and   ●  e-leads  (e.g.,  website  landing  page  submissions,  Calendly,  etc.).

Chapter  4:  Inquiries    
Post-Secondary/Adult  Learner  Inquiries  
While  the  majority  of  your  client  base  will  be  from  Pre-Kindergarten  to  grade  12,  you  may  also  ﬁnd  that  
you
 
have
 
post-secondary
 
and/or
 
adult
 
learners
 
inquiring.
 
But,
 
don’t
 
fear
 
-
 
the
 
process
 
is
 
the
 
exact
 
same
 
no
 
matter
 
the
 
inquiry!
 
Some  additional  considerations:  
●  Oftentimes  adult  learners  have  increased  ﬂexibility  compared  to  students  who  are  in  school;  
therefore,
 
you
 
may
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
utilize
 
your
 
location
 
during
 
daytime
 
hours
 
to
 
accommodate
 
adult
 
learners.
 
 ●  It  is  important  to  remember  that  many  adult  learners  have  not  completed  a  course  in  some  time,  
may
 
have
 
had
 
a
 
bad
 
experience
 
working
 
in
 
a
 
classroom
 
setting,
 
and/or
 
have
 
low
 
conﬁdence
 
in
 
their
 
academic
 
capabilities.
 
Remember
 
to
 
let
 
them
 
know
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
vast
 
amount
 
of
 
experience
 
in
 
helping
 
adult
 
learners.
 
 ●  For  some  adult  learners,  they  are  looking  to  prepare  for  specialized  tests  or  exams  -  i.e.  SAT,  ACT,  
IELTS,
 
etc.
 
It
 
is
 
critical
 
to
 
set
 
appropriate
 
expectations
 
related
 
to
 
their
 
goals,
 
commitments,
 
and
 
timeline.
 
Best  Practices  for  Phone/In-Person  Inquiries:  
1.  Friendly  Greeting:  e.g.,  “ Scholars  of  Location,  how  may  I  help  your  child  learn  today?”  
2.  Ask  and  Listen :  Establish  credibility  and  build  rapport  by  asking  diagnostic  questions  to  
determine
 
the
 
root
 
problem
 
driving
 
the
 
inquiry.
 
These
 
questions
 
will
 
help
 
you
 
decide
 
the
 
appropriate
 
next
 
step
 
for
 
the
 
child
 
(e.g.,
 
assessment,
 
trial
 
hour,
 
etc.).
 ●  Use  the  Inquiry  Form  (IQ’s  Internal  Server  Documents  >  Operations  -  Enrollment  
Documents)
 
to
 
guide
 
your
 
open-ended
 
questioning
 
and
 
note-taking:
 
“May
 
I
 
ask
 
you
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
speciﬁc
 
questions
 
about
 
your
 
child?”
 
3.  Outline  Relevant  “Scholars  Highlights” :  Review  the  investment-justiﬁcation  of  the  purchase  prior  
to
 
providing
 
monthly
 
tuition
 
details.
 
Remember:
 
investment
 
is
 
not
 
just
 
from
 
a
 
ﬁnancial
 
standpoint
 
-
 
consider
 
the
 
time,
 
money,
 
and
 
energy
 
investment.
 ●  Determine  which  features  of  the  Scholars  Solution  to  mention  based  on  the  child’s  
speciﬁc
 
needs
 
in
 
parent-friendly
 
language
 
(e.g.,
 
Manipulative
 
Shelf

enhancing,
 
and
 
extending
 
a
 
student’s
 
learning
 
to
 
bring
 
the
 
concepts
 
to
 
life),
 
Mastery
 
Criteria
 
(every

is
 
paced
 
based
 
on

“Keeping  the  Train  on  the  Tracks”  
While  your  ﬁrst  impression  with  a  prospective  client  is  crucial,  It’s  also  important  to  consider  that  your  
initial
 
inquiry
 
touchpoint
 
is
 
not
 
the
 
only
 
time
 
you
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
connect
 
with
 
a
 
prospective
 
client
 
to
 
learn
 
more
 
about
 
their
 
child[ren],
 
build
 
rapport,
 
and
 
establish
 
your
 
competence
,
 
credibility
,
 
and
 
value
.
 
  As  such,  when  engaging  in  an  inquiry  conversation  that  is  heading  towards  the  desired  result  of  booking  
an
 
assessment,
 
benchmarking
 
session,
 
or
 
trial
 
hour,
 
don’t
 
derail
 
the
 
conversation
 
by
 
asking
 
subsequent
 
questions.
 
You
 
will
 
be
 
connecting
 
with
 
them
 
again
 
soon
 
and
 
can
 
ask
 
any
 
remaining
 
questions
 
at
 
that
 
time!
  
Touchpoint  1:  Initial  Inquiry  Desired  Result :  Book  Assessment,  Benchmarking  Session,  or  Trial  Hour   ●  The  best  measure  of  the  success  of  an  initial  inquiry  conversation  is  whether  or  not  you  were  
able
 
to
 
secure
 
an
 
appointment
 
for
 
the
 
assessment,
 
benchmarking
 
session,
 
or
 
trial
 
hour.
 
If
 
the
 
prospective
 
client
 
is
 
not
 
ready
 
to
 
commit
 
to
 
this
 
appointment
 
right
 
away,
 
establish
 
your
 
follow-up
 
process
 
expectations.
 ●  Digital  Inquiries :  You  should  always  call  to  follow-up  on  digital  inquiries  (e.g.,  to  collect  
more
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
child,
 
build
 
rapport,
 
and/or
 
to
 
conﬁrm
 
appointment
 
time
 
and
 
location).
 ●  Phone/In-Person  Inquiries :  After  booking  the  next  touchpoint,  send  a  follow-up  email  
recapping
 
your
 
conversation
 
along
 
with
 
a
 
Google
 
Calendar
 
invite
 
 
Touchpoint  2:  Assessment,  Benchmarking  Session,  or  Trial  Hour  Desired  Result :  Enroll  student  and/or  book  an  Assessment  Review  Meeting   ●  Before  diving  into  the  assessment,  benchmarking  session,  or  trial  hour,  give  yourself  the  time  to  
have
 
the
 
parent/guardian
 
complete
 
both
 
pages
 
of

Chapter  4:  Inquiries    Server  Documents  >  Operations  -  Enrollment  Documents).  Consider  this  the  “entry  ticket”  to  the  
complimentary
 
evaluation
 
step
 
before
 
enrolling.
 ●  Throughout  this  appointment,  you  must  collect  the  data  required  for  enrollment  and  personalized  
programming,
 
convey
 
the
 
value
 
of
 
Scholars
 
Solution,
 
and
 
build
 
rapport
 
with
 
the
 
parent/guardian
 
and
 
child.
 ●  Ideally,  you  should  meet  brieﬂy  with  the  parent/guardian  immediately  after  the  assessment,  
benchmarking
 
session,
 
or
 
trial
 
hour
 
to
 
provide
 
an
 
overview
 
of
 
the
 
student’s
 
learning
 
skills
 
and
 
observed
 
performance
 
in
 
an
 
eﬀort
 
to
 
enroll
 
the
 
student
 
immediately
 
-
 
capitalize
 
on
 
the
 
urgency
 
and
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
already
 
present
 
with
 
you.
 ○  If  the  parent/guardian  would  like  to  see  the  assessment  results  prior  to  enrolling,  book  an  
Assessment
 
Review
 
Meeting
 
as
 
soon
 
as
 
possible
 
to
 
convert
 
to
 
an
 
enrollment.
 
 ●  Even  if  the  student  enrolls  after  the  initial  assessment,  book  an  Assessment  Review  Meeting  as  
soon
 
as
 
possible
 
-
 
or
 
even
 
at
 
the
 
beginning
 
of
 
their
 
ﬁrst
 
session
 
-
 
to
 
build
 
rapport
 
with
 
the
 
parent/guardian
 
and
 
convey
 
the
 
credibility
 
of
 
the
 
Scholars
 
Solution.

Meeting
 Desired  Result :  Enroll  student  and/or  convey  credibility  and  value  of  the  Scholars  program   ●  Assessment  Review  Meeting:  in  this  meeting,  you  will  present  the  student’s  completed  
Assessment
 
Record
 
to
 
the
 
parent/guardian
 
outlining
 
the
 
student’s
 
academic
 
skills
 
demonstrated,
 
along
 
with
 
observations
 
about
 
the
 
child
 
not
 
found
 
in
 
the
 
correct
 
and
 
incorrect
 
answers,
 
and
 
the
 
next
 
steps
 
for
 
the
 
student’s
 
personalized
 
programming.
 ●  Benchmarking  Session/Trial  Hour  Review  Call:  in  this  conversation,  you  will  present  the  
observations
 
made
 
during
 
the

Individualized  Inquiries  
Finding  the  “Root”   The  most  important  aspect  of  any  inquiry  is  to  determine  the  root  cause  of  their  inquiry.  This  goes  
beyond
 
simply
 
asking
 
what
 
the
 
client
 
is
 
looking
 
for.
 
If
 
a
 
parent/guardian
 
states
 
that
 
they’re
 
calling
 
regarding
 
math
 
help,
 
don’t
 
just
 
focus
 
on
 
math,
 
ask
 
follow-up
 
questions
 
regarding
 
their
 
language
 
skills
 
–
 
especially
 
reading
 
comprehension.
 
If
 
they
 
can’t
 
understand
 
what
 
they’re
 
reading,
 
their
 
math
 
skills
 
aren’t
 
the
 
root
 
cause
 
of
 
their
 
academic
 
struggles.
 
Demonstrate
 
that
 
you
 
are
 
invested
 
in
 
understanding
 
the
 
student
 
as
 
a
 
whole
!

Chapter  4:  Inquiries    We’re  in  the  business  of  authentic  connections  and  building  relationships ;  we  just  happen  to  do  it  by  
providing
 
outstanding
 
tutoring,
 
mentorship,
 
and
 
supplemental
 
education.
 
Our
 
focus
 
should
 
always
 
be
 
on
 
the
 
individual:
 
to
 
develop
 
a
 
student
 
who
 
is
 
conﬁdent,
 
independent,
 
willing
 
to
 
take
 
risks,
 
and
 
not
 
be
 
afraid
 
to
 
make
 
mistakes
 
-
 
to
 
name
 
a
 
few
 
qualities.
 
Our
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
help
 
children
 
become
 
autonomous
 
thinkers
 
and
 
develop
 
critical
 
thinking
 
skills
 
—
 
not
 
just
 
focus
 
on
 
their
 
academics.
 
  
Highlight  Features  of  the  “Scholars  Solution”  In  order  to  convey  value  and  credibility,  our  guiding-questions  will  help  determine  which  features  of  the  
Scholars
 
Solution
 
will
 
be
 
relevant
 
to
 
share
 
with
 
each
 
individual
 
inquiry.
 
It’s
 
important
 
to
 
note
 
that
 
not
 
all
 
of
 
these
 
highlights
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
shared
 
during
 
the
 
initial
 
inquiry
 
conversations.
 
Consider
 
focusing
 
on
 
those
 
that
 
provide
 
a
 
“solution”
 
to
 
the
 
student’s
 
“problem”
 
and
 
demonstrate
 
the
 
value
 
of
 
our
 
programming.
  For  example,  a  parent  who  is  speaking  about  their  child  being  frustrated  in  class  because  they  aren’t  
keeping
 
up
 
with
 
their
 
peers
 
(and
 
are
 
noticing
 
this
 
themselves)
 
and
 
are
 
lacking
 
engagement
 
and
 
motivation,
 
would
 
have
 
the
 
complimentary
 
assessment,
 
mastery
 
criteria,
 
and
 
Scholars
 
Store
 
highlighted
 
in
 
their
 
conversation,
 
whereas
 
a
 
high
 
school
 
student
 
who
 
is
 
achieving
 
at
 
a
 
high
 
level
 
already
 
and
 
is
 
looking
 
into
 
advanced
 
placements
 
likely
 
won’t
 
be
 
interested
 
in
 
hearing
 
about
 
the
 
Scholars
 
Store
 
(despite
 
them
 
still
 
earning
 
points
 
every
 
session)
  Complimentary  Evaluations  
No  matter  what  program  a  student  is  enrolling  in,  every  student  receives  a  complimentary  evaluation  
before
 
beginning
 
their
 
ﬁrst
 
paid
 
session.
 
This
 
complimentary
 
evaluation
 
type
 
is
 
determined
 
by
 
the
 
program
 
they
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
enrolled
 
in.
  These  complementary  evaluations  are  part  of  the  enrollment ,  not  just  a  step  to  complete.  While  the  
information
 
can
 
help
 
with
 
the
 
ﬁnal
 
conversion
 
of
 
a
 
student,
 
these
 
evaluations
 
should
 
only
 
be
 
completed
 
for
 
clients
 
who
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
good
 
deal
 
of
 
certainty
 
about
 
enrolling
 
rather
 
than
 
someone
 
who
 
just
 
wants
 
the
 
information
 
to
 
take
 
back
 
to
 
the
 
school.
  When  booking  any  complimentary  evaluation,  it’s  important  to  give  yourself  some  buﬀer  time  at  the  
beginning
 
and
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
evaluation
 
so
 
you
 
can
 
complete
 
all
 
aspects
 
of
 
the
 
evaluation
 
without
 
you
 
or
 
the
 
child
 
feeling
 
rushed,
 
giving
 
appropriate
 
time
 
to
 
answer
 
parent/guardian’s
 
questions,
 
and
 
sharing
 
your
 
initial
 
observations
 
with
 
the
 
goal
 
of
 
enrolling
 
them
 
before
 
they
 
leave.
 
  See  Chapter  5:  Assessments  for  more  information  about  our  assessments,  benchmarking  sessions,  and  
trial
 
hours
 
and
 
their
 
related
 
processes.

Chapter  4:  Inquiries    Complimentary  Assessment  
The  ﬁrst  step  in  creating  any  elementary  reading,  writing,  or  math  program  is  completing  a  
complimentary
 
assessment.
 
The
 
assessment
 
results
 
allow
 
us
 
to
 
construct
 
an
 
entirely
 
individualized
 
program
 
that
 
bolsters
 
the
 
student’s
 
academic
 
weaknesses
 
while
 
leveraging
 
their
 
strengths.
 
We
 
use
 
the
 
assessment
 
for
 
all
 
elementary
 
students,
 
whether
 
they
 
are
 
looking
 
to
 
catch
 
up,
 
keep
 
up,
 
or
 
get
 
ahead.
 
Not
 
only
 
is
 
the
 
assessment
 
necessary
 
to
 
build
 
the
 
child’s
 
individualized
 
program,
 
but
 
it
 
is
 
also
 
a
 
signiﬁcant
 
diﬀerentiator
 
between
 
Scholars
 
and
 
our
 
competitors
 
(i.e.,
 
not
 
a
 
“one-size-ﬁts-all”
 
solution).
 
  Complimentary  French  Benchmarking  Session 
All  students  heading  into  French  programs  receive  a  complimentary  benchmarking  session.  During  this  
session,
 
students
 
will
 
work
 
on
 
a

  Complimentary  High  School  Trial  Hour 
For  high  school,  students  complete  a  complimentary  trial  hour.  During  this  time,  you  and  one  of  your  
subject-specialist
 
teachers
 
will
 
determine
 
more
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
student’s
 
strengths
 
and
 
weaknesses
 
-
 
not
 
just
 
from
 
a

standpoint,
 
but
 
also
 
considering
 
their
 
skills,
 
strategies,
 
and

This

is
 
an

it
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
homework

or
 
a

on
 
Friday.
  Scholars  Competitive  Edge  
Conferences  &  Reassessments  
We  meet  with  parents/guardians  after  every  12  hours  of  instruction  for  an  individualized  conference.  The  
conference
 
is
 
a
 
time
 
where
 
we
 
provide
 
a
 
report
 
on
 
concepts
 
students
 
have
 
completed
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
12
 
classes,
 
what
 
they’re
 
currently
 
working
 
on,
 
and
 
set
 
goals
 
and
 
expectations
 
for
 
what
 
they
 
will
 
be
 
working
 
on
 
in
 
the
 
next
 
12
 
classes
 
and
 
beyond.
 
  Every  36-hour  interval  for  those  students  who  completed  an  initial  assessment,  in  addition  to  their  
conference,
 
we
 
also
 
complete
 
a
 
reassessment
 
to
 
determine
 
their
 
progress
 
since
 
their
 
last
 
assessment.
 
Not
 
only
 
does
 
this
 
allow
 
us
 
to
 
make
 
any
 
necessary
 
adjustments
 
to
 
their
 
program,
 
but
 
it
 
also
 
demonstrates
 
their
 
growth
 
to
 
the
 
parent/guardian.
 
Many
 
of
 
our
 
competitors
 
oﬀer
 
a
 
“one-size-ﬁts-all”
 
approach
 
to
 
learning,
 
making
 
our
 
assessments
 
and
 
conferences
 
a
 
key
 
competitive
 
advantage.

  Manipulative  Shelf  
The  Manipulative  Shelf  is  a  key  aspect  of  our  programming  and  the  physical  embodiment  of  our  Enrich,  
Enhance,
 
Extend
 
pedagogy.
 
 
We
 
use
 
physical
 
manipulatives
 
to
 
engage
 
our
 
student’s
 
unique
 
learning
 
styles,
 
apply
 
learned
 
concepts
 
in
 
various
 
scenarios,
 
and
 
infuse
 
our
 
lessons
 
with
 
engaging
 
activities.
 
The
 
Manipulative
 
Shelf
 
helps
 
us
 
separate
 
ourselves
 
from
 
our
 
competitors
 
who
 
focus
 
on
 
“kill-and-drill”
 
worksheets
 
to
 
the
 
detriment
 
of
 
student
 
engagement.
  Mastery  Criteria  
Unlike  school  –  where  the  class  moves  on  to  the  next  unit  regardless  of  an  individual  student’s  
understanding
 
of
 
a
 
concept
 
–
 
Scholars
 
students
 
do
 
not
 
“move
 
on”
 
until
 
they
 
are
 
conﬁdent
 
and
 
competent
 
in
 
their
 
understanding
 
of
 
a
 
concept.
 
“Mastery
 
learning”
 
is
 
an
 
instructional
 
approach
 
where
 
educational
 
progress
 
is
 
based
 
on
 
performance
 
rather
 
than
 
time
 
spent.
 
Learners
 
at
 
Scholars
 
are
 
given
 
multiple
 
lessons
 
about
 
the
 
same
 
concept
 
until
 
they
 
reach
 
the
 
required
 
mastery
 
level.
 
At
 
Scholars,
 
no
 
student
 
is
 
left
 
behind!
 
Must-Have  Expectatations  
For  all  inquiries,  it  is  critical  to  use  a  portion  of  your  time  to  outline  and  establish  expectations  with  
parents/guardians
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
you
 
are
 
aligned
 
on
 
all
 
fronts
 
before
 
they
 
come
 
in
 
for
 
a
 
complimentary
 
assessment,
 
benchmarking
 
session,
 
or
 
trial
 
hour.

Chapter  4:  Inquiries    There  is  nothing  worse  than  having  a  student  complete  a  fantastic  trial  hour,  only  to  be  met  with  “Oh,  this  
is
 
too
 
expensive.
 
My
 
budget
 
is
 
$20
 
an
 
hour,”
 
when
 
you
 
discuss
 
the
 
next
 
steps
 
of
 
enrolling
 
their
 
child
 
into
 
Scholars.
  Frequency  &  Scheduling  
All  students  who  attend  Scholars  should  begin  with  full-time  enrollments  per  subject  -  i.e.,  attend  a  
minimum
 
of
 
two
 
one-hour
 
sessions
 
per
 
week.
 
Students
 
who
 
attend
 
with
 
this
 
frequency
 
see
 
an
 
average
 
increase
 
of
 
one
 
full
 
grade
 
level
 
after
 
40
 
hours
 
of
 
sessions
 
in
 
the
 
focused
 
subject
 
area.
 
This
 
frequency
 
also
 
maximizes
 
retention,
 
gives
 
the
 
best
 
return
 
on
 
investment,
 
and
 
builds
 
strong
 
learning
 
habits
 
and
 
routines.
 
  Students  who  attend  less  than  two  one-hour  sessions  per  week  per  subject  are  considered  to  be  on  a  
“maintenance”
 
enrollment.
 
Students
 
who
 
attend
 
with
 
this
 
frequency
 
will
 
see
 
limited
 
marked
 
gains
 
towards
 
their
 
goals.
 
Ensure
 
that
 
you
 
manage
 
expectations
 
for
 
parents
 
seeking
 
this
 
solution;
 
though
 
these
 
students
 
will
 
certainly
 
still
 
see
 
some
 
growth,
 
the
 
trajectory
 
and
 
return
 
on
 
investment
 
will
 
be
 
considerably
 
slower.
 
  Most  families  prefer  a  schedule  where  the  student  attends  classes  on  two  diﬀerent  days  that  aren’t  
back-to-back,
 
such
 
as
 
Monday/Wednesday,
 
Tuesday/Thursday,
 
or
 
Wednesday/Saturday.
 
Non-back-to-back
 
sessions
 
will
 
also
 
result
 
in
 
the
 
best
 
progress
 
results
 
since
 
the
 
instruction
 
is
 
spread
 
out
 
over
 
the
 
course
 
of
 
a
 
week.
  We  pride  ourselves  on  being  understanding,  accommodating,  and  ﬂexible  with  scheduling.  Unlike  other  
extra-curricular
 
activities
 
where
 
there
 
are
 
limited
 
days
 
and
 
times
 
for
 
basketball
 
practice,
 
swim
 
lessons
 
for
 
their
 
level,
 
or
 
other
 
group-based
 
activities,
 
students
 
can
 
come
 
to
 
Scholars
 
whenever
 
we
 
have
 
available
 
times
 
and
 
competent
 
subject-speciﬁc
 
teachers
 
available!
 
Ultimately,
 
every
 
student
 
should
 
receive
 
a
 
minimum
 
of
 
eight,
 
one-hour
 
classes
 
every
 
month
 
to
 
ensure
 
progress.
  Please  review  the  make-up  classes  policy  outlined  in  the  Enrollment  Form   (IQ’s  Internal  Server  
Documents
 
>
 
Operations
 
-
 
Enrollment
 
Documents).
 
  Teaching  Ratios  
At  Scholars,  we  work  in  small  student-to-teacher  ratios  -  a  maximum  of  3:1  or  2:1  ratio  depending  on  the  
program.
 
This
 
means
 
that
 
there
 
are
 
two
 
or
 
three
 
students
 
at
 
the
 
teaching
 
table
 
with
 
one
 
teacher.
 
During
 
the
 
session,
 
each
 
student
 
is
 
on
 
their
 
own
 
individualized
 
program
 
and
 
receives
 
individualized
 
attention
 
throughout
 
the
 
class
 
as
 
the
 
teacher
 
is
 
connected
 
to
 
that
 
table
 
for
 
the
 
entire
 
session
 
as
 
opposed
 
to
 
having
 
teacher(s)
 
roam
 
around
 
a
 
room
 
or
 
hop
 
between
 
students.

Chapter  4:  Inquiries     Teaching  in  these  small  student-to-teacher  ratios  -  i.e.,  not  one-on-one  -  supports  a  student’s  
development
 
of
 
their
 
skills,
 
strategies,
 
and
 
habits,
 
including
 
independence,
 
problem-solving,
 
and
 
autonomy
 
–
 
essential
 
skills
 
for
 
success
 
outside
 
the
 
four
 
walls
 
of
 
the
 
Scholars
 
space,
 
whether
 
that
 
be
 
in
 
their
 
larger-ratio
 
classrooms
 
at
 
school
 
or
 
when
 
attempting
 
homework
 
alone
 
at
 
home..
 
  Program  Ratios:  
●  For  all  GAP  programs  (grades  1-8  reading,  writing,  or  math  curriculum  programs),  the  ratio  is  a  
maximum
 
of
 
3:1
 ●  For  all  French,  LTT  (high  school),  and  Reading  Readiness  programs,  the  ratio  is  2:1.   
Ultimately,  by  the  end  of  a  student’s  time  with  us,  we  want  to  develop  an  independent  student  who  can  
complete
 
their
 
work
 
on
 
their
 
own,
 
take
 
risks,
 
and
 
not
 
be
 
afraid
 
to
 
make
 
mistakes,
 
which
 
can
 
only
 
be
 
accomplished
 
in
 
our
 
small
 
group
 
ratios.
 
  Tuition  Rates  
Tuition  rates  should  always  be  presented  as  a  monthly  rate.  If  parents/guardians  only  hear  the  per-class  
rate,
 
they
 
often
 
think
 
of
 
each
 
class
 
individually
 
and
 
are
 
less
 
likely
 
to
 
stay
 
committed
 
to
 
the
 
schedule
 
and
 
be
 
reliable.
 
  However,  the  ﬁrst  month  is  usually  prorated  based  on  the  number  of  classes  the  student  will  receive  
since
 
most
 
students
 
do
 
not
 
start
 
at
 
the
 
very
 
beginning
 
of
 
the
 
month.
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
only
 
time
 
we
 
prorate
 
or
 
work
 
on
 
a
 
per-class
 
basis.
  Payment  Tiers:  
Many  locations  will  develop  payment  “tiers”  connected  to  the  varying  program  types  oﬀered  at  Scholars,  
along
 
with
 
loyalty
 
pricing
 
for
 
families
 
or
 
students
 
who
 
are
 
enrolled
 
in
 
more
 
than
 
one
 
full-time
 
subject
 
enrollment.
 
An
 
example
 
of
 
most
 
common
 
tier
 
structure
 
is:
  ●  GAP/Reading  Readiness:  $55/hr  -  i.e.,  minimum  $440/month  based  on  recurring  schedule  ●  LTT  or  French:  $60/hr  -  i.e.,  minimum  $480/month  based  on  recurring  schedule  
 ●  Sibling/loyalty  pricing  (minimum  of  16  hours  a  month  when  enrolled  in  full-time  programs)  with  the  
ﬁrst
 
student/program
 
entered
 
at
 
the
 
full
 
hourly
 
rate
 
and
 
then
 
sibling/loyalty
 
rate
 
applied
 
to
 
the
 
sibling
 
or
 
second
 
program
 
if
 
being
 
used
 
by
 
the
 
same
 
student.
 
(Generally,
 
about
 
a
 
10%
 
rate
 
savings)

Chapter  4:  Inquiries    ○  GAP/Reading  Readiness:  $50/hr  -  i.e.,  minimum  $400/month  based  on  recurring  schedule  ○  LTT  or  French:  $55  -  i.e.,  minimum  $440/month  based  on  recurring  schedule   Payment  Options :   
All  parents  are  on  some  form  of  pre-authorized  payment  method.  As  outlined  on  the  Enrollment  Form  
(IQ’s
 
Internal
 
Server
 
Documents
 
>
 
Operations
 
-
 
Enrollment
 
Documents),
 
the
 
two
 
approved
 
forms
 
of
 
payment
 
are:
 
●  credit  card,  or   ●  pre-authorized  debit  (PAD)  from  their  bank  account  
Do  not  provide  any  other  options  for  payment.  It  is  not  worth  your  time  chasing  clients  every  month  to  
collect
 
cash,
 
e-transfer,
 
cheque,
 
or
 
on-site
 
point-of-sale
 
(POS)
 
terminal
 
payments.
  Best  Practices:  
●  Always  process  payments  on  the  ﬁrst  of  the  month  for  that  same  month.   ●  Do  not  bill  at  the  end  of  the  month  for  the  classes  attended  that  month,  or  you  will  spend  
countless
 
hours
 
each
 
month
 
on
 
billing,
 
and
 
clients
 
will
 
not
 
respect
 
scheduling,
 
make-up,
 
and
 
payment
 
policies.
 
○  Note:  this  best  practice  is  also  aligned  with  IQ’s  logic  for  many  of  its  features  and  
functionalities,
 
including,
 
but
 
not
 
limited
 
to
 
the
 
Monthly
 
Billing
 
Report
 
-
 
i.e.,
 
variable
 
monthly
 
billing,
 
billed
 
at
 
the
 
beginning
 
of
 
each
 
month
 
Next  Steps  If  you  have  had  a  successful  initial  inquiry,  the  next  step  before  ending  the  conversation  is  to  schedule  
the
 
complimentary
 
assessment
 
for
 
elementary
 
reading,
 
writing,
 
or
 
math
 
students,
 
a
 
complimentary
 
benchmarking
 
session
 
for
 
French
 
students,
 
or
 
a
 
complimentary
 
trial
 
hour
 
for
 
high
 
school
 
students.
 
  TIP:  If  the  client  is  hesitant  to  schedule  an  assessment,  benchmarking  session,  or  trial  hour,  you  can  
suggest
 
they
 
come
 
for
 
an
 
on-site
 
visit
 
to
 
see
 
the
 
location
 
in
 
action!
 
The  Follow-Up  Process:  The  “7-in-7”  
As  we  discussed  already  in  this  chapter,  from  an  initial  inquiry,  our  desired  result  is  to  book  an  
assessment,
 
benchmarking
 
session,
 
or
 
trial
 
hour.
 
However,
 
that
 
isn’t
 
always
 
the
 
case,
 
and,
 
as
 
such,
 
we
 
must
 
engage
 
in
 
a
 
systematic
 
follow-up
 
process.

Chapter  4:  Inquiries    Certainly,  we  would  love  -  and  maybe  even  expect  -  to  convert  a  client  the  ﬁrst  time  we  meet  a  
prospective
 
client.
 
Yet
 
studies
 
reveal
 
that
 
only
 
2%
 
of
 
sales
 
occur
 
when
 
two
 
parties
 
meet
 
for
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
time.
  The  2%  who  commit  after  a  ﬁrst  meeting  tend  to  be  people  who  have  already  looked  into  the  subject  
matter,
 
and
 
already
 
know
 
what
 
they're
 
looking
 
for.
 
If
 
they
 
meet
 
someone
 
who
 
ticks
 
all
 
the
 
right
 
boxes
 
and
 
they
 
get
 
on
 
well,
 
then
 
business
 
may
 
well
 
be
 
transacted.
 
But
 
that
 
is
 
far
 
from
 
the
 
norm.
 
The
 
other
 
98%
 
will
 
only
 
buy
 
once
 
a
 
certain
 
level
 
of
 
trust
 
has
 
been
 
built.
  Anyone  who  believes  they  can  go  into  a  sales  situation  armed  with  '101  sure-ﬁre  sales  closes'  and  make  
sales
 
is
 
seriously
 
misinformed
 
-
 
and
 
about
 
20
 
years
 
behind
 
the
 
times.
 
Our
 
highest
 
conversion-makers
 
in
 the  system  are  those  who  truly  get  to  know  their  prospects,  understand  their  problem  and  provide  irrefutable  proof  that  Scholars  is  the  solution  for  their  child[ren].  They  build  relationships  and  trust by  engaging  in  ongoing  dialogue  (otherwise  known  as  follow-up)  rather  than  just  peddling  their  products  
and
 
services
 
with
 
an
 
armoury
 
of
 
closing
 
tricks.
  
The  “7-in-7”  Methodology  
★  Follow-Up  One:   ○  In  our  most  ideal  scenario,  after  the  initial  inquiry,  the  assessment,  benchmarking  session,  or  trial  hour  has  been  booked,  we  will  send  a  follow-up  email  as  discussed  in  the  Best  Practices  for  Phone/In-Person  Inquiries and  Best  Practices  for  Digital  Inquiries above.  ○  If  a  client  has  not  committed  to  the  assessment,  benchmarking  session,  or  trial  hour,  by  
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
initial
 
inquiry
 
conversation,
 
we
 
will
 
also
 
follow-up
 
with

Chapter  4:  Inquiries    ★  And  so  on,  as  shown  in  the  graphic  below:   
 
Best  Practices   
●  Remember  that  the  parent/guardian  has  reached  out  to  you  because  they  have  a  problem  that  
they
 
are
 
looking
 
for
 
the
 
solution
 
to.
 
Therefore,
 
you
 
following
 
up
 
with
 
them
 
shows
 
your
 
commitment
 
to
 
their
 
child[ren]’s
 
success.
 ●  Prepare  for  each  follow-up  conversation  by  reviewing  the  student’s  lead  proﬁle  notes  in  IQ  to  
ensure
 
that
 
you
 
are
 
providing
 
personalized
 
messaging
 
about
 
how
 
Scholars
 
can
 
help
 
their
 
child[ren]
 
rather
 
than
 
a
 
“I’m
 
just
 
following
 
up”-style
 
message.
 ●  While  we  refer  to  this  process  as  the  “7-in-7”,  if  a  parent  shares  that  they  need  a  few  days  to  
review
 
the
 
information
 
with
 
their
 
partner,
 
for
 
example,
 
then
 
certainly
 
we
 
will
 
move
 
our
 
next
 
follow-up.
 ●  Following  through  with  your  follow-up  plan  demonstrates  strong  integrity  -  doing  what  you  say  
you’re
 
going
 
to
 
do
 
-
 
which
 
is
 
crucial
 
for
 
building
 
trust
 
and
 
strengthening
 
your
 
credibility
.
 
 ●  All  follow-up  communication  touchpoints  are  to  be  logged  into  the  student’s  lead  proﬁle  in  IQ.   
 
Handling  Objections  
The  more  you  understand  why  a  prospective  client  might  be  hesitant  to  enroll,  the  better  equipped  you  
are
 
to
 
get
 
them
 
signed
 
up
 
right
 
away.
 
Don’t
 
let
 
these
 
objections
 
become
 
an
 
obstacle
 
to
 
a
 
conversion!
 
Ask
 
questions
 
and
 
show
 
them
 
a
 
perspective
 
they
 
may
 
not
 
have
 
previously
 
considered.

Chapter  4:  Inquiries    TIP :  Place  a  copy  of  the  Quick  Reference  Guide:  Handling  Objections found  as  an  appendix  to  this  Playbook  on  the  clipboard  that  holds  your  Inquiry  Forms  in  your  oﬃce.    
1.  Cost:  “That’s  really  expensive.”  Price  objections  are  the  most  common  sales  objection  there  is.  Why?  Because  money  is  on  top  of  
everyone’s
 
mind.
 
But
 
the
 
price
 
is
 
all
 
about
 
perceived
 
value.
 
The
 
number
 
one
 
tactic
 
to
 
avoid
 
this
 
objection
 
from
 
arising
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
place
 
is
 
to
 
never
 
begin
 
the
 
conversation
 
by
 
discussing
 
price
 
–
 
focus
 
on
 
the
 
parent,
 
their
 
pain
 
points,
 
and
 
how
 
your
 
solution
 
will
 
beneﬁt
 
them.
 
  Their  opinion  on  your  price  all  comes  down  to  perceived  value  –  make  the  value  of  your  solution  
known
 
before
 
discussing
 
the
 
cost,
 
and
 
you
 
will
 
signiﬁcantly
 
minimize
 
the
 
likelihood
 
of
 
this
 
objection
 
arising.
 
  When  presented  with  this  objection,  emphasize  features  of  the  Scholars  Solution  that  add  value  
(e.g.,
 
our
 
complimentary
 
assessment,
 
benchmarking
 
session,
 
or
 
trial
 
hour,
 
our
 
frequent
 
conference
 
reporting,
 
our
 
reassessments,
 
our
 
Manipulative
 
Shelf,
 
our
 
Scholars
 
Store,
 
our
 
low
 
student-to-teacher
 
ratio,
 
etc.).
 
  You  can  also  ask  the  parent  why  they  think  that  our  solution  is  too  expensive.  The  parent  then  
has
 
to
 
break
 
down
 
their
 
reasoning
 
which
 
gives
 
you
 
another
 
insight
 
into
 
their
 
perspective.
 
Some
 
parents
 
may
 
not
 
understand
 
the
 
short-
 
and
 
long-term
 
costs
 
of
 
maintaining
 
the
 
status
 
quo.
 
In
 
order
 
to
 
break
 
the
 
status
 
quo
 
for
 
this
 
parent,
 
you
 
can
 
highlight
 
the
 
costs
 
of
 
anxiety,
 
being
 
held
 
back
 
in
 
future
 
grades,
 
not
 
developing
 
long-term
 
study
 
habits,
 
and
 
more.You
 
can
 
then
 
address
 
these
 
issues
 
speciﬁcally,
 
which
 
will
 
lead
 
the
 
conversation
 
in
 
the
 
right
 
direction.
  Sample  Responses:   ●  “Our  prices  are  reﬂective  of  the  personalization  of  our  programs  and  student  success  
across
 
our
 
network.”
 ○  “On  average,  students  go  up  an  entire  grade  level  after  just  40  hours  at  Scholars.  
That’s
 
a
 
year’s
 
worth
 
of
 
learning!”
 ●  “ We  want  to  prove  to  you  why  our  program  is  the  best  and  share  the  value  we  can  oﬀer  
to
 
you
 
and
 
your
 
child.
 
That
 
being
 
said,
 
can
 
you
 
tell
 
me
 
a
 
little
 
more
 
about
 
your
 
child
 
and
 
why
 
you
 
think
 
the
 
solution
 
is
 
too
 
expensive?
”
 ●  “What  is  the  value  of  increased  conﬁdence,  lower  anxiety  and  transferrable  study  and  
problem-solving
 
skills?”

Chapter  4:  Inquiries    
2.  Affordability:  “That’s  out  of  my  budget.”  It  can  be  challenging  when  someone  understands  the  value  of  the  Scholars  Solution,  but  states  
that
 
the
 
tuition
 
is
 
out
 
of
 
their
 
budget.
 
Meet
 
these
 
objections
 
with
 
validation
 
and
 
empathy.
 
We
 
do
 
not
 
minimize
 
this
 
objection
 
by
 
pretending
 
that
 
our
 
programs
 
are
 
not
 
considered
 
to
 
be
 
expensive
 
to
 
some
 
families.
 
  Deals  and  discounts  cheapen  the  brand,  so  if  a  parent  legitimately  cannot  aﬀord  our  services,  
then
 
now
 
may
 
not
 
be
 
the
 
right
 
time
 
for
 
them
 
to
 
enroll
 
with
 
us,
 
and
 
we
 
must
 
leave
 
the
 
door
 
open
 
for
 
them
 
to
 
enroll
 
should
 
their
 
circumstances
 
change
 
in
 
the
 
future..
  Sample  Responses:   ●  “ I  understand  that  Scholars  is  currently  out  of  your  budget.  We  would  love  to  help  your  
child
 
when
 
the
 
time
 
is
 
right.
 
Let’s
 
connect
 
again
 
in
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
months
 
to
 
see
 
if
 
anything
 
has
 
changed.
”
 ●  “Is  there  anyone  else  in  the  family  who  can  help  pay  for  this  tutoring?  We  know  students  
who
 
get
 
help
 
from
 
grandparents,
 
etc.”
  
3.  Key  Decision-Maker:  “I  need  to  speak  with  my  partner.”  Sometimes,  the  person  you  are  talking  to  is  not  the  only  “key  decision-maker”  in  the  “purchase.”  
In
 
some
 
cases,
 
they
 
may
 
be
 
procrastinating
 
on
 
making
 
a
 
decision
 
and
 
in
 
others,
 
they
 
are
 
simply
 
the
 
family
 
member
 
tasked
 
with
 
sourcing
 
the
 
information.
  It  will  be  quite  apparent  whether  you  are  speaking  to  the  decision-maker  or  not,  especially  when  
you
 
begin
 
speaking
 
about
 
the
 
tuition,
 
schedule,
 
and
 
commitment.
 
It
 
is
 
important
 
to
 
present
 
your
 
solution
 
to
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
people
 
involved
 
in
 
making
 
the
 
decision
 
to
 
ensure
 
everyone
 
is
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
page.
 
  Keep  the  process  moving  by  oﬀering  to  talk  to  all  parties:  Dad,  grandparents,  and  maybe  even  
their
 
aunt.
 
Getting
 
all
 
decision-makers
 
in
 
one
 
room
 
will
 
help
 
you
 
have
 
more
 
control
 
over
 
the
 
conversion
 
and
 
facilitate
 
the
 
decision,
 
as
 
you
 
can
 
present
 
as
 
much
 
insight
 
as
 
possible.
 
This
 
is
 
where
 
you
 
send
 
that
 
Google
 
Calendar
 
invitation
 
to
 
secure
 
their
 
time
 
and
 
attention.
   Sample  Responses:   ●  “ I  understand  completely.  I  will  send  a  follow-up  email  outlining  all  of  the  information  that  
we
 
just
 
discussed
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
share.
 
I
 
will
 
also
 
share
 
some
 
available
 
days
 
and
 
times
 
in
 
the
 
upcoming
 
days
 
for
 
us
 
to
 
hop
 
on
 
a
 
call
 
or
 
schedule
 
an
 
on-site
 
visit
 
for
 
you
 
all
 
to
 
come
 
in
 
for
 
a
 
meeting
 
so
 
we
 
can
 
discuss
 
with
 
your
 
family.”

Chapter  4:  Inquiries    ●  “I’ll  send  you  a  follow-up  email  with  everything  we  just  discussed.  Then,  I’ll  give  you  and  
your
 
partner
 
a
 
call
 
tomorrow
 
after
 
you’ve
 
had
 
a
 
chance
 
to
 
go
 
over
 
the
 
details
 
together.”
  
4.  Rushing:  “I  don’t  have  that  much  time  right  now.  Just  send  me  the  
information.”
 This  objection  is  one  way  of  saying  “this  isn’t  critically  important  to  me  right  now”  or  could  be  a  
sign
 
that
 
you
 
haven’t
 
translated
 
enough
 
value
 
of
 
your
 
solution.
 
Use
 
open-ended
 
questions
 
to
 
get
 
them
 
talking
 
about
 
their
 
child.
 
If
 
the
 
parent/guardian
 
does
 
not
 
engage,
 
reschedule
 
the
 
call
 
for
 
a
 
better
 
time
 
or
 
invite
 
them
 
to
 
the
 
location
 
to
 
see
 
our
 
program
 
in
 
action!
 
Emphasize
 
that
 
parents
 
have
 
found
 
this
 
in-location
 
touchpoint
 
to
 
be
 
an
 
easier
 
method
 
of
 
fully
 
understanding
 
our
 
solution.
  If  the  client  shares  that  the  reason  they  are  rushing  has  to  do  with  their  child,  use  this  to  your  
advantage
 
by
 
showing
 
how
 
your
 
solution
 
could
 
help
 
ease
 
their
 
pain
 
(e.g.,
 
building
 
learning
 
skills,
 
developing
 
routine,
 
etc.).
 
Our
 
solution
 
helps
 
make
 
their
 
lives
 
easier
 
–
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
great
 
time
 
to
 
emphasize
 
that!
  Sample  Responses:   ●  “ I  hear  you  -  it’s  a  crazy  time  of  year!  In  order  to  provide  you  with  some  speciﬁc  
information
 
for
 
your
 
child’s
 
personalized
 
programming,
 
can
 
I
 
ask
 
you
 
just
 
three
 
questions?”
  
 ●  “ I’d  be  happy  to  send  you  some  information  via  email,  but  I’d  like  to  ask  you  a  few  
questions
 
ﬁrst
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
I
 
send
 
you
 
the
 
most
 
relevant
 
information
 
for
 
you
 
and
 
your
 
child.”
 ●  “Our  families  tend  to  ﬁnd  it  valuable  seeing  the  steps  we  take  to  get  results  in  person.  
Would
 
you
 
be
 
interested
 
in
 
coming
 
in
 
to
 
go
 
over
 
everything?
 
I
 
have
 
availability
 
on
 
xx
 
and
 
yy.
”
 ●  “We  know  all  about  busy  schedules!  Our  team  at  Scholars  is  well-versed  in  managing  
students
 
who
 
require
 
schedule
 
ﬂexibility.
 
How
 
about
 
I
 
call
 
you
 
back
 
at
 
xx
 
or
 
yy?”
 
 
5.  Scheduling:  “We  don’t  have  time  to  come  two  hours  per  week!”  This  objection  may  result  when  you  have  not  adequately  translated  the  value  of  the  Scholars  
Solution.
 
Two
 
hours
 
per
 
week
 
is
 
only
 
a
 
minor
 
commitment
 
in
 
exchange
 
for
 
the
 
immense
 
value
 
that
 
we
 
oﬀer!
 
Address
 
this
 
objection
 
by
 
reinforcing
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
learning,
 
the
 
ﬂexibility
 
of
 
our
 
make-up
 
classes
 
policy,
 
and
 
by
 
drawing
 
comparisons
 
with
 
their
 
other
 
extra-curriculars
 
(e.g.,
 
like
 
sports
 
and
 
music,

essential
 
for
 
building
 
conﬁdence
 
and
 
competency
 
in
 
reading/writing,

Chapter  4:  Inquiries    Sample  Responses:  ●  “I’m  hearing  that  your  child  goes  to  hockey  practice  three  times  a  week.  That’s  a  big  
commitment!
 
But
 
just
 
like
 
in
 
hockey,
 
practice
 
is
 
essential
 
for
 
building
 
conﬁdence,
 
competency,
 
and
 
passion
 
for
 
reading.
 
Could
 
you
 
squeeze
 
in
 
an
 
hour
 
right
 
after
 
school
 
twice
 
a
 
week?”
 ●  “We  are  well-versed  in  handling  busy  families!  That’s  why  we  oﬀer  ﬂexible  scheduling  
options
 
and
 
a
 
make-up
 
policy
 
to
 
ﬁt
 
around
 
your
 
schedule.
 
Which
 
days
 
are
 
most
 
convenient
 
for
 
you?”
 ●  “We  absolutely  understand  how  busy  schedules  can  be.  That’s  why  our  program  is  
designed
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
biggest
 
impact
 
in
 
the
 
least
 
amount
 
of
 
time
 
possible:
 
two
 
hours
 
per
 
week
 
ensures
 
retention
 
while
 
building
 
healthy
 
learning
 
habits
 
and
 
routines.”
 ●  Summer:  “Though  it  may  seem  like  a  big  commitment,  two  hours  per  week  is  just  1%  of  
your
 
total
 
summer!”
  
6.  Ratios  and  In-Home  Tutoring:  “We  want  a  1:1  tutor.”  or  “We  want  a  
tutor
 
who
 
will
 
come
 
to
 
our
 
house.”
 Some  parents  may  believe  that  a  1:1  tutoring  solution  oﬀers  more  personalized  attention  and  
customization,
 
leading
 
to
 
faster
 
progress.
 
This
 
couldn’t
 
be
 
further
 
from
 
the
 
truth!
 
In
 
fact,
 
we
 
ﬁnd
 
that
 
students
 
show
 
the
 
same
 
–
 
if
 
not
 
more
 
–
 
progress
 
in
 
a
 
2:1
 
or
 
3:1
 
ratio
 
in
 
our
 
programs.
 
  Teachers  at  our  ratio  can  maintain  personalized  attention  while  discouraging  “over-reliance”  on  
tutors
 
that
 
sometimes
 
comes
 
with
 
1:1
 
ratios.
 
Moreover,
 
our
 
in-location
 
ratios
 
oﬀer
 
a
 
microcosm
 
of
 
a
 
school
 
classroom
 
(i.e.,
 
a
 
classroom
 
on
 
a
 
smaller/more
 
manageable
 
scale)
 
so
 
that
 
students
 
can
 
transfer
 
their
 
learning
 
to
 
school
 
with
 
ease.
  Sample  Responses:  ●  “Our  locations  are  designed  to  mimic  a  classroom  on  a  smaller  scale,  which  makes  it  
easier
 
for
 
our
 
students
 
to
 
transfer
 
their
 
understanding
 
to
 
their
 
school
 
classroom
 
with
 
conﬁdence!”
 
 ○  “Studies  show  that  test  scores  improve  dramatically  when  the  study  environment  
is
 
similar
 
to
 
the
 
testing
 
environment.
 
Studying
 
in
 
a
 
location
 
that
 
is
 
organized
 
like
 
a
 
classroom
 
will
 
be
 
much
 
better
 
for
 
retention
 
than
 
studying
 
at
 
your
 
kitchen
 
table!”
 ●  ”Our  students  thrive  in  this  3:1  ratio  and  show  the  same  –  if  not  better  –  results  than  1:1  
tutoring.
 
In
 
a
 
3:1
 
setting,
 
students
 
receive
 
personalized
 
attention,
 
but
 
they
 
also
 
have
 
the
 
opportunity
 
to
 
develop
 
their
 
own
 
skills,
 
strategies,
 
and
 
habit
 
toolbox,
 
without
 
immediately
 
relying
 
on
 
their
 
tutor
 
for
 
help.
 
Plus,
 
they
 
get
 
to
 
develop
 
essential
 
social
 
skills
 
too!”

7.  Homework:  “Do  you  give  homework?  We  want  to  keep  working  on  
these
 
concepts
 
at
 
home.”
 Parents  sometimes  believe  that  homework  is  necessary  to  reinforce  learned  concepts,  prepare  
for

expectations,
 
build
 
study
 
habits,
 
and
 
to
 
ensure
 
they
 
are
 
informed
 
about
 
their
 
child’s
 
learning.
 
  At  Scholars,  we  do  not  send  students  home  with  homework ,  as  every  student’s  programming  
and
 
success
 
is
 
based
 
on
 
activities
 
that
 
are
 
fully
 
supported
 
by
 
a
 
Scholars
 
teacher,
 
which
 
takes
 
the
 
burden
 
oﬀ
 
of
 
parents,
 
especially
 
if
 
students
 
are
 
already
 
inundated
 
with
 
school
 
homework,
 
and
 
ensures
 
that
 
we
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
consistently
 
evaluate
 
a
 
student’s
 
progress
 
and
 
mastery
 
-
 
e.g.,
 
the
 
parent
 
is
 
not
 
the
 
one
 
completing
 
the
 
homework
 
assignments
 
for
 
the
 
child.
  This  doesn’t  mean  that  we  want  to  discourage  parental  involvement  and  engagement.  Consider:  ●  Book  recommendations  for  families  to  read  together  at  home  ●  For  students  working  on  letter  identiﬁcation,  have  the  parent/guardian  pick  a  letter  and  
ask
 
the
 
child
 
to
 
ﬁnd
 
as
 
many
 
signs
 
with
 
that
 
letter
 
on
 
their
 
trip
 
to
 
Scholars.
 ●  Recommend  quick  practice  (no  more  than  ﬁve  minutes)  on  an  app  for  mental  math  or  fast  
fact
 
recall
  Sample  Responses:  ●  “Our  philosophy  is  to  take  the  burden  oﬀ  of  the  parent,  so  most  of  our  students  do  not  
take
 
additional
 
work
 
home!
 
The
 
program
 
is
 
designed
 
to
 
be
 
successful
 
without
 
it.
 
Having
 
said
 
that,
 
I’m
 
happy
 
to
 
share
 
some
 
great
 
books
 
for
 
you
 
and
 
your
 
child
 
to
 
read
 
together
 
at
 
home.”
 
  
8.  School  Supports:  “I  don’t  think  we  need  two  hours  per  week.  My  
child
 
has
 
an
 
EA
 
and
 
their
 
IEP
 
was
 
just
 
updated.”
 “Accessibility”  is  not  the  same  as  “education.”  School  supports  like  Educational  Assistants  and  
Individual
 
Education
 
Plans
 
help
 
make
 
education
 
more
 
approachable
 
for
 
the
 
child,
 
but
 
they
 
are
 
not
 
a
 
substitute
 
for
 
personalized
 
lessons,
 
especially
 
lessons
 
that
 
ﬁll
 
in
 
knowledge
 
gaps
 
from
 
previous
 
grade
 
levels.
 
Parents
 
may
 
believe
 
that
 
these
 
solutions
 
will
 
address
 
their
 
pain
 
points
 
without
 
the
 
Scholars
 
Solution,
 
but
 
they
 
are
 
usually
 
incorrect
 
in
 
this
 
assumption.
 
  Sample  Responses:   ●  “I’m  so  happy  that  your  child  has  an  EA!  However,  an  EA  is  an  accessibility  aid  intended  
to
 
make
 
classroom
 
material
 
more
 
accessible;
 
it’s
 
not
 
going
 
to
 
provide
 
personalized

Chapter  4:  Inquiries    lessons  or  ﬁll  the  knowledge  gaps  from  previous  grade  levels.  That’s  where  we  come  in!”   
 
9.  Child’s  Personality:  “My  child  hates  school.  It’s  going  to  be  
impossible
 
to
 
get
 
them
 
to
 
show
 
up
 
for
 
tutoring
 
two
 
hours
 
per
 
week.”
 A  parent’s  perception  of  their  child’s  personality  and  attitudes  can  signiﬁcantly  inﬂuence  their  
willingness
 
to
 
invest
 
in
 
tutoring.
 
If
 
a
 
child
 
has
 
a
 
strong
 
dislike
 
for
 
school,
 
parents
 
may
 
anticipate
 
that
 
tutoring
 
will
 
be
 
another
 
emotional
 
battle,
 
leading
 
them
 
to
 
resist
 
the
 
idea.
 
Parents
 
might
 
also
 
worry
 
that
 
adding
 
tutoring
 
to
 
an
 
already
 
negative
 
school
 
experience
 
will
 
overwhelm
 
their
 
child,
 
leading
 
to
 
frustration,
 
disengagement,
 
and
 
burnout.
 
  One  way  to  address  this  is  by  highlighting  how  Scholars  feels  diﬀerent  from  school.  Emphasizing  
interactive,
 
low-pressure
 
learning,
 
engaging
 
elements,
 
and
 
short
 
session
 
times
 
can
 
help
 
ease
 
their
 
concerns.
  Sample  Responses:  ●  “I  can  certainly  understand  that.  A  beneﬁt  of  Scholars  is  that  you’re  not  just  investing  in  
education:
 
you’re
 
investing
 
in
 
a
 
team
 
of
 
teachers
 
who
 
are
 
dedicated
 
to
 
building
 
your
 
child’s
 
openness
 
to
 
learning.
 
You
 
won’t
 
be
 
ﬁghting
 
these
 
battles
 
alone
 
anymore!
 
We’ve
 
got
 
your
 
back.”
 ●  “Students  who  struggle  in  school  often  thrive  at  Scholars  due  to  the  small  ratios,  our  
Enrich,
 
Enhance,
 
Extend
 
approach,
 
and
 
our
 
personalized
 
programs,
 
which
 
ensure
 
that
 
each
 
child’s
 
lessons
 
are
 
exactly
 
aligned
 
with
 
their
 
existing
 
knowledge.
 
They
 
won’t
 
feel
 
overwhelmed
 
by
 
challenging
 
concepts
 
like
 
they
 
might
 
be
 
at
 
school!”
 
  
10.  Competitors:  “I’m  going  to  call  around  to  other  tutoring  companies  
before
 
I
 
make
 
any
 
commitments.”
 
 Tutoring  is  an  investment.  We  do  not  discourage  potential  clients  from  exploring  their  options  
prior
 
to
 
enrolling.
 
In
 
fact,
 
we
 
encourage
 
it!
 
If
 
a
 
parent
 
appears
 
to
 
be
 
in
 
“information-collection
 
mode,”
 
empower
 
them
 
to
 
continue
 
their
 
research
 
with
 
guiding
 
questions
 
that
 
will
 
get
 
them
 
to
 
recognize
 
the
 
Scholars
 
Solution
 
on
 
their
 
own.
 
  Choose  the  questions  that  are  most  appropriate  for  the  student  given  the  context  of  the  call.  After  
providing
 
these
 
guiding
 
questions,
 
let
 
them
 
know
 
that
 
you
 
will
 
call
 
them
 
back
 
the
 
next
 
day
 
to
 
follow-up
 
on
 
their
 
research
 
process.
 
These
 
questions
 
are
 
designed
 
to
 
show
 
parents
 
what
 
makes
 
Scholars
 
diﬀerent
 
and,
 
more
 
importantly,
 
better
 
than
 
the
 
competition.

Chapter  4:  Inquiries    Sample  Responses:  ●  “Great  idea!  We  absolutely  encourage  you  to  do  your  research  prior  to  enrolling.  Based  
on
 
what
 
I’ve
 
heard
 
about
 
your
 
child,
 
I
 
have
 
some
 
questions
 
you
 
should
 
be
 
asking
 
when
 
you
 
call
 
around:
 ○  What  are  their  student-to-teacher  ratios?   ■  Ours  are  a  maximum  of  3:1;  some  tutoring  companies  have  one  teacher  
walking
 
around
 
and
 
supervising
 
all
 
the
 
students
 
in
 
the
 
classroom
 
as
 
they
 
do
 
independent
 
work.
 
 ○  Do  they  start  with  an  assessment  to  personalize  their  lessons?  Do  they  oﬀer  
reassessments
 
after
 
36
 
hours
 
in
 
the
 
program?
 ■  Some  tutoring  companies  have  a  one-size-ﬁts  all  approach.  We  tailor  all  
our
 
lessons
 
to
 
the
 
child
 
and
 
reassess
 
the
 
student
 
after
 
36
 
hours
 
to
 
see
 
their
 
growth
 
and
 
make
 
any
 
necessary
 
adjustments
 
to
 
their
 
program.
 ○  Do  they  progress  updates  to  you  every  12  hours,  if  at  all?  ■  We  conference  with  you  every  12  hours  to  keep  you  informed  about  your  
child’s
 
progress
 
and
 
update
 
their
 
learning
 
goals.
 ○  Do  they  oﬀer  a  Team  Approach  to  learning?  ■  With  your  support,  we  will  contact  your  child’s  teacher  to  determine  how  to  
best
 
support
 
them.
 ○  What  are  their  teachers’  education  levels?   ■  All  of  our  teachers  have  a  university-level  education  or  above,  and  they’re  
all
 
trained
 
Scholars
 
teachers
 
and
 
mentors.
 ○  Do  they  use  “oﬀ-paper”  tools  and  resources  to  engage  diﬀerent  learning  styles?  
Or
 
do
 
they
 
just
 
use
 
worksheets?
 I  will  include  these  questions  in  my  follow-up  email!”  
Frequently  Asked  Questions  
In  addition  to  objections,  there  are  a  number  of  frequently  asked  questions  that  you  should  be  prepared  
to
 
answer
 
during
 
an
 
inquiry.
 
Oftentimes
 
parents
 
are
 
asking
 
these
 
questions
 
because
 
they
 
believe
 
they
 
are
 
the
 
“right”
 
questions
 
to
 
ask.
 
Being
 
prepared
 
and
 
having
 
conﬁdent
 
explanations,
 
even
 
when
 
you
 
have
 
to
 
say
 
no,
 
will
 
establish
 
you
 
as
 
an
 
authority
 
in
 
supplemental
 
education.
  
1.  “Can  my  child  attend  for  just  one  hour  a  week?”  In  order  for  the  program  to  be  eﬀective  and  for  our  students  to  see  progress,  all  students  attend  
Scholars
 
twice
 
a
 
week
 
minimum
 
(i.e.
 
a
 
full-time
 
enrollment).
 
Students
 
with
 
this
 
schedule
 
see
 
an
 
average
 
increase
 
of
 
one
 
full
 
grade
 
level
 
after
 
40
 
hours
 
of
 
sessions
 
in
 
the
 
focused
 
subject
 
area.
 
All
 
students
 
should
 
begin
 
their
 
Scholars
 
journey
 
with
 
this
 
frequency
 
as
 
it
 
maximizes
 
retention,

Chapter  4:  Inquiries    gives  the  best  return  on  investment,  and  builds  strong  learning  habits  and  routines.  For  high  
school
 
students,
 
their
 
courses
 
often
 
cover
 
more
 
than
 
one
 
chapter
 
in
 
a
 
week.
 
That
 
being
 
the
 
case,
 
they
 
need
 
to
 
attend
 
at
 
least
 
twice
 
per
 
week
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
keep
 
up
 
with
 
the
 
pace
 
of
 
the
 
classroom
 
and
 
ensure
 
no
 
gaps
 
are
 
being
 
created.
  Clients  who  are  looking  to  “get  ahead”  (i.e.,  enrichment)  may  have  more  diﬃculty  understanding  
the
 
value
 
of
 
a
 
full-time
 
enrollment.
 
However,
 
moving
 
from
 
90%
 
to
 
95%
 
is
 
much
 
more
 
challenging
 
than
 
moving
 
from
 
60%
 
to
 
70%!
 
Even
 
though
 
the
 
child
 
may
 
be
 
doing
 
well
 
academically,
 
if
 
the
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
get
 
them
 
from
 
90%
 
to
 
95%,
 
that
 
will
 
not
 
happen
 
by
 
coming
 
once
 
per
 
week.
 
Emphasize
 
that
 
learning
 
is
 
like
 
sports
 
or
 
music,
 
practice
 
makes
 
perfect!
 
(You
 
do
 
not
 
stop
 
going
 
to
 
soccer
 
practice
 
just
 
because
 
you’re
 
the
 
best
 
on
 
the
 
team,
 
especially
 
if
 
you
 
are
 
wanting
 
to
 
be
 
drafted!)
  Any  student  who  attends  less  than  two  one-hour  sessions  per  week  per  subject  is  considered  to  
be
 
on
 
a
 
“maintenance”
 
enrollment.
 
Ensure
 
that
 
you
 
manage
 
expectations
 
for
 
parents
 
seeking
 
this
 
solution;
 
though
 
these
 
students
 
will
 
certainly
 
still
 
see
 
some
 
growth,
 
the
 
trajectory
 
and
 
return
 
on
 
investment
 
will
 
be
 
considerably
 
slower.
 
  
2.  “How  long  will  this  take?”  We  recognize  that  every  child  progresses  diﬀerently,  but  on  average  we  see  that  it  takes  40  
hours
 
to
 
move
 
up
 
one
 
grade
 
level
 
in
 
a
 
given
 
subject
.
 
Within
 
your
 
location,
 
your
 
entire
 
team
 
should
 
be
 
constantly
 
evaluating
 
how
 
students
 
are
 
doing
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
concepts
 
are
 
not
 
too
 
easy
 
or
 
too
 
diﬃcult.
 
In
 
addition,
 
with
 
the
 
conference
 
that
 
occurs
 
after
 
every
 
12
 
hours
 
of
 
instruction,
 
you
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
keep
 
parents
 
informed
 
of
 
their
 
child’s
 
progress.
 
Additionally,
 
after
 
every
 
36
 
hours
 
of
 
instruction,
 
you
 
will
 
reassess
 
students
 
in
 
elementary
 
reading,
 
writing,
 
and
 
math
 
programs
 
to
 
determine
 
and
 
demonstrate
 
the
 
progress
 
made
 
since
 
their
 
initial
 
assessment.
 
  
3.  “Do  I  have  to  sign  a  contract?”  There  is  no  long-term  contract  when  enrolling  at  Scholars  since  tuition  is  paid  month-by-month;  
however,
 
you
 
do
 
want
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
you
 
have
 
set
 
appropriate
 
commitment
 
expectations
 
with
 
the
 
parents
 
from
 
the
 
beginning.
 
The
 
withdrawal
 
policy
 
is
 
outlined
 
in
 
the
 
Enrollment
 
Form

4.  “Are  all  of  your  teachers  “certiﬁed”  teachers?”  Throughout  our  system,  you  will  ﬁnd  the  phrase  “certiﬁed  teachers  and  qualiﬁed  mentors”  when  
referencing
 
our
 
teachers.
 
Though
 
all
 
of
 
our
 
teachers
 
have
 
at
 
least
 
some
 
post-secondary

Chapter  4:  Inquiries    education,  you  will  ﬁnd  that  the  majority  of  our  locations  have  a  variety  of  backgrounds,  skill  sets,  
and
 
certiﬁcations.
 
The
 
most
 
important
 
qualities
 
that
 
we
 
are
 
looking
 
for
 
in
 
teachers
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
certiﬁcate,
 
but
 
rather
 
someone
 
who
 
is
 
qualiﬁed
 
and
 
passionate
 
about
 
helping
 
students
 
succeed.
 
Teachers
 
also
 
receive
 
Scholars
 
Teacher
 
Training
 
on
 
our
 
teaching
 
philosophy
 
and
 
programs
 
to
 
ensure
 
they
 
are
 
qualiﬁed
 
to
 
teach
 
and
 
support
 
students
 
at
 
the
 
highest
 
level
 
at
 
our
 
locations.
 
  
5.  “Can  students  get  help  with  their  homework  during  their  class?”  Since  our  high  school  program  focuses  on  speciﬁc  subject  support,  it  is  pivotal  that  high  school  
students
 
bring
 
in
 
their
 
binders,
 
textbooks,
 
assignments,
 
along
 
with
 
completed
 
quizzes
 
and
 
tests
 
so
 
we
 
can
 
oﬀer
 
them
 
the
 
optimal
 
level
 
of
 
support.
 
  For  elementary  students,  our  focus  is  always  on  ﬁlling  in  skill  gaps  and  building  a  foundation  for  
students
 
for
 
long-term
 
success.
 
If
 
a
 
student
 
is
 
behind,
 
they
 
will
 
obviously
 
have
 
diﬃculty
 
with
 
the
 
material
 
at
 
their
 
current
 
grade
 
level,
 
so
 
the
 
best
 
thing
 
to
 
do
 
is
 
focus
 
on
 
getting
 
them
 
up
 
to
 
grade
 
level.
 
  While  we  want  to  help  alleviate  any  stress,  frustration,  and  anxiety  a  student  is  experiencing  with  
a
 
concept,
 
if
 
we
 
only
 
work
 
on
 
homework,
 
then
 
the
 
root
 
problem
 
is
 
never
 
truly
 
resolved
 
and
 
will
 
only
 
worsen.
 
That
 
is
 
why
 
we
 
spend
 
a
 
maximum
 
of
 
ten
 
minutes
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
each
 
class
 
(if
 
required)
 
on
 
relevant
 
and
 
necessary
 
school
 
homework
 
that
 
a
 
student
 
needs
 
support
 
with.
 
  Any  time  given  for  school  homework  at  Scholars  should  not  be  spent  working  on  something  the  
student
 
isn’t
 
having
 
diﬃculty
 
with
 
and
 
just
 
needs
 
to
 
ﬁnish.
 
All
 
in
 
all,
 
the
 
majority
 
of
 
the
 
time
 
spent
 
at
 
the
 
location
 
is
 
on
 
building
 
the
 
foundations
 
for
 
long-term
 
success
 
rather
 
than
 
providing
 
a
 
short-term,
 
“band-aid”
 
solution.
  
6.  “Is  it  one-on-one  tutoring?  Why  do  you  teach  at  a  3:1  or  2:1  ratio?”  As  you  already  know,  at  Scholars  we  work  in  small  student-to-teacher  ratios.  During  their  time  at  
Scholars,
 
every
 
student
 
works
 
on
 
their
 
own
 
individualized
 
program
 
that
 
is
 
built
 
to
 
suit
 
their
 
unique
 
strengths
 
and
 
areas
 
for
 
improvement.
 
  Not  only  are  we  working  on  academic  skills  at  Scholars,  we  are  also  working  to  build  student’s  
conﬁdence,
 
independence,
 
skills,
 
strategies,
 
and
 
habits,
 
which
 
are
 
critical
 
to
 
their
 
success
 
outside
 
of
 
Scholars.
 
Ultimately,
 
a
 
maximum
 
of
 
a
 
3:1
 
ratio
 
allows

Chapter  4:  Inquiries    (e.g.,  self-regulation,  cooperation,  etc.)  and  independent  problem  solving  (without  the  
overreliance
 
on
 
the
 
teacher
 
that
 
comes
 
with
 
a
 
1:1
 
ratio).
  
7.  “Will  my  child  sit  with  students  their  own  age?”  When  matching  up  students  to  teaching  tables,  the  ﬁrst  thing  that  should  be  considered  is  “what  
will
 
be
 
the
 
best
 
for
 
this
 
child?”
 
Since
 
students
 
are
 
all
 
working
 
on
 
their
 
own
 
individual
 
programs,
 
they
 
do
 
not
 
need
 
to
 
sit
 
with
 
other
 
students
 
their
 
own
 
age
 
or
 
even
 
at
 
their
 
own
 
ability
 
level,
 
so
 
use
 
the
 
information
 
you
 
gathered
 
from
 
the
 
inquiry
 
conversations,
 
follow-ups,
 
and
 
assessment
 
to
 
match
 
students
 
together
 
appropriately
 
with
 
teachers
 
who
 
you
 
think
 
will
 
best
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
support
 
them.
  As  a  result,  you  may  have  students  who  are  sitting  with  peers  their  own  age,  or  you  may  have  
them
 
grouped
 
by
 
their
 
ability
 
level.
 
Conversely,
 
you
 
may
 
have
 
some
 
teaching
 
tables
 
grouped
 
by
 
a
 
teacher’s
 
specialty
 
-
 
i.e.
 
French
 
or
 
Physics
 
-
 
or
 
in
 
any
 
other
 
combination
 
possible
 
as
 
well.
  TIP:  It’s  not  necessary  -  and  is  actually  discouraged  -  to  have  a  student  fully  committed  to  a  single  
teacher’s
 
schedule.
 
In
 
your
 
teaching
 
team,
 
you
 
will
 
have
 
a
 
wonderfully
 
diverse
 
group
 
of
 
teachers
 
who
 
are
 
all
 
competent,
 
conﬁdent,
 
passionate,
 
and
 
trained
 
to
 
support
 
a
 
variety
 
of
 
students
 
-
 
give
 
your
 
students
 
the
 
opportunity
 
to
 
experience
 
them
 
all!
  While  you  may  assume  that  “attaching”  a  student  to  a  teacher  for  every  session  will  aid  in  
retention,
 
it
 
can
 
have
 
the
 
exact
 
opposite
 
eﬀect
 
if
 
the
 
teacher
 
they
 
have
 
worked
 
with
 
is
 
sick,
 
goes
 
on
 
vacation,
 
or
 
moves
 
on
 
to
 
another
 
opportunity
 
themselves.
 
The
 
student
 
will
 
often
 
follow
 
out
 
the
 
door
 
behind
 
them.
  
8.  “My  child  needs  help  with  all  subjects.  Can  they  work  on  reading,  
writing,
 
math,
 
French,
 
and
 
their
 
homework
 
at
 
Scholars?”
 At  times,  parents  may  present  a  long  list  of  problems  they  are  looking  for  solutions  with.  This  is  
where
 
determining
 
the
 
root
 
cause
 
and
 
setting
 
expectations
 
is
 
paramount!
 
As
 
we
 
know,
 
reading
 
is
 
the
 
foundation
 
for
 
all
 
other
 
subjects.
 
If
 
a
 
student
 
is
 
having
 
diﬃculty
 
in
 
math,
 
it
 
may
 
be
 
because
 
they
 
cannot
 
read
 
and/or
 
comprehend
 
the
 
instructions
 
and/or
 
word
 
problems.
 
As
 
such,
 
the
 
majority
 
of
 
our
 
students
 
will
 
enroll
 
in
 
a
 
reading
 
program
 
ﬁrst
 
and
 
foremost.
  Since  every  subject  requires  a  minimum  of  two  hours  a  week,  if  a  parent  is  willing  to  commit  to  
four
 
hours
 
a
 
week,
 
then
 
a
 
child
 
could
 
certainly
 
work
 
on
 
two
 
subjects.
 
However,
 
we
 
would
 
not

of

Chapter  4:  Inquiries    recommend  more  than  four  hours  a  week  during  the  school  year  as  the  child  may  experience  
burnout.
 
In
 
this
 
case,
 
you
 
would
 
complete
 
the
 
two
 
subject
 
assessments
 
on
 
diﬀerent
 
days
 
to
 
ensure
 
you
 
are
 
getting
 
the
 
most
 
accurate
 
results.
 
  Ultimately,  in  order  to  see  progress,  students’  programs  need  to  be  focused  and  intentional.  Do  
not
 
look
 
at
 
this
 
long
 
list
 
of
 
problems
 
that
 
a
 
parent
 
presents
 
as
 
a
 
challenge,
 
but
 
rather
 
as
 
an
 
opportunity!
 
When
 
you
 
demonstrate
 
a
 
student’s
 
growth
 
and
 
progress,
 
they
 
will
 
be
 
ready
 
to
 
continue
 
working
 
through
 
their
 
child’s
 
areas
 
of
 
need
 
following
 
the
 
logical
 
and
 
systematic
 
plan
 
that
 
you
 
put
 
in
 
place
 
from
 
the
 
very
 
beginning.

Chapter  5:  Assessments    
Assessments  
A  critical  premise  in  the  Scholars  philosophy  is  the  belief  that  certain  fundamentals  need  to  be  
understood
 
and
 
mastered
 
before
 
true
 
comprehension
 
occurs.
 
Assessments
 
help
 
determine
 
the
 
student’s
 
academic
 
strengths
 
and
 
weaknesses,
 
and
 
allows
 
Scholars
 
to
 
develop
 
an
 
individualized
 
program
 
to
 
address
 
any
 
skill
 
gaps,
 
which
 
helps
 
them
 
achieve
 
academic
 
success.
 
Only
 
certiﬁed
 
assessors
 
or
 
assessors
 
in
 
training
 
may
 
administer
 
the
 
assessment
 
since
 
adhering
 
to
 
all
 
assessment
 
procedures
 
is
 
essential
 
to
 
maintaining
 
the
 
integrity
 
and
 
quality
 
of
 
the
 
assessment.
 
In
 
order
 
to
 
be
 
eligible
 
to
 
be
 
an
 
assessor
 
in
 
training,
 
individuals
 
must

Chapter  5:  Assessments    
The  Initial  Assessment  Process  
The  initial  assessment  is  often  our  ﬁrst  in-person  encounter  with  a  client  and  it  presents  another  great  
opportunity
 
to
 
continue
 
to
 
build
 
competence,
 
credibility
,
 
and
 
value
 
with
 
the
 
family.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
ensure
 
that
 
you
 
are
 
completing
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
following
 
steps
 
whenever
 
assessing
 
a
 
student:
 
Before  the  Assessment  ▢  Ensure  that  you  have  allocated  enough  time  to  complete  all  required  aspects  of  the  assessment,  
along
 
with
 
buﬀer
 
time
 
for
 
the
 
parent/guardian
 
to
 
complete
 
the
 
Student
 
Information
 
Form
 
(IQ’s
 
Internal
 
Server
 
Documents
 
>
 
Operations
 
-
 
Enrollment
 
Documents)
 
and
 
any
 
of
 
their
 
outstanding
 
questions
 
prior
 
to
 
the
 
assessment.
 ▢  Review  appropriate  information  from  the  Inquiry  Form  (IQ’s  Internal  Server  Documents  >  
Operations
 
-
 
Enrollment
 
Documents)
 
and/or
 
the
 
student’s
 
lead
 
proﬁle
 
in
 
IQ
 
prior
 
to
 
the
 
parent
 
and
 
student’s
 
arrival.
 ▢  Ensure  that  your  oﬃce  presents  a  welcoming  and  organized  atmosphere  -  i.e.  no  other  student  
folders
 
sitting
 
on
 
the
 
desk
 
or
 
ﬁlling
 
cabinet
 ▢  Have  the  Student  Information  Form  (IQ’s  Internal  Server  Documents  >  Operations  -  Enrollment  
Documents)
 
ready
 
for
 
parents
 
to
 
ﬁll
 
out
 
while
 
the
 
student
 
starts
 
their
 
assessment.
 
You
 
should
 
also
 
have
 
an
 
Enrollment
 
Folder
 
ready,
 
with
 
a
 
copy
 
of
 
the
 
Enrollment
 
Form
 
(IQ’s
 
Internal
 
Server
 
Documents
 
>
 
Operations
 
-
 
Enrollment
 
Documents)
 
ready,
 
as
 
many
 
students
 
will
 
be
 
ready
 
to
 
enroll
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
this
 
session
 
meeting.
 ▢  Ensure  that  your  assessment  room  is  clean  and  that  all  test  materials  are  ready  prior  to  their  
arrival.
 
Provide
 
at
 
least
 
two
 
sharpened
 
pencils
 
and
 
an
 
eraser.
 ▢  Upon  arrival,  greet  the  student  and  parent  by  name  and  introduce  yourself.  Review  the  
assessment
 
process,
 
including
 
timelines.
 
Parents
 
are
 
welcome
 
to
 
wait
 
in
 
the
 
waiting
 
room
 
or
 
run
 
some
 
errands
 
while
 
their
 
child
 
is
 
completing
 
the
 
assessment;
 
however,
 
they
 
cannot
 
sit
 
in
 
the
 
teaching
 
area
 
or
 
the
 
assessment
 
room
 
while
 
the
 
student
 
is
 
working
 
as
 
this
 
will
 
impact
 
the
 
validity
 
of
 
the
 
student’s
 
results.
 ○  TIP:  For  younger  students,  consider  assessing  them  in  the  front  oﬃce  while  the  parent  
can
 
see
 
them
 
through
 
the
 
windows
 
in
 
the
 
lobby/oﬃce
 
to
 
help
 
ease
 
any
 
separation
 
anxiety.
 ▢  Spend  time  developing  a  rapport  with  the  student  and  parent,  taking  the  student  on  a  tour,  and  
highlighting
 
some
 
aspects
 
of
 
the
 
location
 
they
 
may
 
enjoy
 
-
 
the
 
Manipulative
 
Shelf,
 
the
 
Scholars
 
Store,
 
etc.
 ▢  Have  the  parent  fully  complete  both  pages  of  the  Student  Information  Form   (IQ’s  Internal  Server  
Documents
 
>
 
Operations
 
-
 
Enrollment
 
Documents)on-site.
 
This
 
form
 
should
 
not
 
be
 
taken
 
home
 
and
 
returned
 
at
 
a
 
later
 
time.

Chapter  5:  Assessments    ○  TIP:  While  they  are  ﬁlling  out  this  form  before  you  start  the  assessment  with  the  student  is  
a
 
great
 
time
 
to
 
ask
 
and
 
answer
 
any
 
further
 
questions.
 ▢  After,  walk  the  student  to  the  assessment  room  (or  remain  in  the  front  oﬃce)  and  have  them  
begin
 
the
 
assessment
 
as
 
per
 
the
 
assessor
 
instructions
 
for
 
that
 
assessment.
 
 
During  the  Assessment  ▢  Use  positive  reinforcement  throughout  the  assessment  to  help  build  conﬁdence  and  create  a  
positive
 
environment,
 
but
 
don’t
 
go
 
overboard!
 
 ○  Focus  on  clear  and  speciﬁc  praise  that  is  not  solely  focused  on  academics  -  e.g.,  “You  are  
doing
 
so
 
well
 
at
 
rereading
 
the
 
questions
 
again.”
 ○  Verbal  praise  is  not  required  after  every  answer  -  e.g.,  “That’s  right!  Good  job!  You  got  it!”  ▢  Control  your  tone  facial  expressions  –  do  not  give  any  clues  about  whether  a  student  answered  
correctly
 
vs.
 
incorrectly.
 
 ▢  Do  not  provide  any  extra  comments  or  instructions  other  than  those  dictated  in  the  assessor’s  
instructions.
 
Extra
 
information
 
will
 
result
 
in
 
an
 
inaccurate
 
assessment
 
result.
 ▢  Use  the  Scholars  Assessment  Observation  Record  (IQ’s  Internal  Server  Documents  >  Operations  -  
Assessment
 
Documents)
 
to
 
take
 
thorough
 
notes
 
throughout
 
the
 
assessment
 
so
 
you
 
can
 
share
 
your
 
initial
 
anecdotal
 
observations
 
with
 
the
 
parent
 
post-assessment
 
and
 
to
 
support
 
the
 
writing
 
of
 
detailed
 
comments
 
in
 
the
 
Assessment
 
Record
 
to
 
provide
 
valuable
 
and
 
ample
 
feedback
 
to
 
the
 
parents.
 
 ○  Note  any  waning  of  attention  –  take  a  break  if  necessary.  ○  Note  the  student’s  body  language  -  conﬁdence,  self-esteem,  anxiety,  ﬁdgeting,  focus,  
fatigue,
 
etc.
 
 ○  Note  if  they  utilize  ﬁnger  tracking  when  reading,  their  pencil  grip,  and/or  how  they  hold  a  
book.
 
 ○  Note  how  the  student  forms  letters  and  numbers  -  i.e.  -  they  should  be  starting  at  the  top  
and
 
working
 
downward.
 
 ○  Note  if  the  student  asks  you  to  repeat  questions.  This  may  be  a  result  of  the  student  
having
 
hearing
 
challenge
 
or
 
auditory
 
processing
 
weakness
 ○  Note  if  the  student  is  very  close  to  the  page  in  order  to  read.  This  may  be  an  indicator  of  
some
 
vision
 
diﬃculties.
 ○  Note  any  strategies  used  during  the  assessment  (drawing  pictures  to  help  with  math  or  
comprehension,
 
using
 
a
 
number
 
line,
 
spelling
 
tricks,
 
self-correcting,
 
etc.)
 
 ○  Does  the  student  persevere?  Take  risks?  Demonstrate  strong  organization,  attention  to  
detail,
 
or
 
time
 
management
 
strategies?

Chapter  5:  Assessments    ▢  For  students  who  complete  CAT-3  Level  14+  assessments,  the  assessor  completes  the  sample  
questions
 
for
 
each
 
section
 
with
 
the
 
student
 
and
 
then
 
the
 
student
 
can
 
proceed
 
with
 
answering
 
independently.
 
However,
 
it’s
 
crucial
 
for
 
the
 
assessor
 
to
 
continue
 
to
 
monitor
 
their
 
progress
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
they
 
aren’t
 
overwhelmed,
 
able
 
to
 
complete
 
the
 
required
 
questions,
 
and
 
have
 
observations
 
to
 
ﬁll
 
their
 
Scholars
 
Assessment
 
Observation
 
Record
 
(IQ’s
 
Internal
 
Server
 
Documents
 
>
 
Operations
 
-
 
Assessment
 
Documents).
 
 
After  the  Assessment  ▢  Ideally,  you  should  meet  brieﬂy  with  the  parent/guardian  immediately  after  the  assessment  to  
provide
 
an
 
overview
 
of
 
the
 
student’s
 
learning
 
skills
 
and
 
observed
 
performance
 
in
 
an
 
eﬀort
 
to
 
enroll
 
the
 
student
 
immediately
 
-
 
capitalize
 
on
 
the
 
urgency
 
and
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
already
 
present
 
with
 
you.
 ○  If  the  parent/guardian  would  like  to  see  the  assessment  results  prior  to  enrolling,  book  an  
Assessment
 
Review
 
Meeting
 
as
 
soon
 
as
 
possible
 
to
 
convert
 
to
 
an
 
enrollment.
 
 ▢  Even  if  the  student  enrolls  after  the  initial  assessment,  book  an  Assessment  Review  Meeting  as  
soon
 
as
 
possible
 
-
 
or
 
even
 
at
 
the
 
beginning
 
of
 
their
 
ﬁrst
 
session
 
-
 
to
 
build
 
rapport
 
with
 
the
 
parent/guardian
 
and
 
convey
 
the
 
credibility
 
of
 
the
 
Scholars
 
Solution.
 ▢  If  you  are  working  towards  your  assessor  certiﬁcation,  remember  that  you  must  submit  all  
assessment
 
documents
 
to
 
Head
 
Oﬃce
 
for
 
review
 
before
 
presenting
 
the
 
formal
 
Assessment
 
Record
 
and
 
corresponding
 
data
 
to
 
the
 
parents.
 ▢  Ask  the  parents  if  they  have  any  further  questions.  ▢  Give  the  child  a  small  Scholars’  token,  such  as  a  small  promotional  item  (pencil,  pen,  stress  ball,  
etc.)
 
or
 
a
 
Scholars
 
Apple
 
with
 
xx
 
points
 
on
 
it.
 
If
 
the
 
student
 
brings
 
the
 
Scholars
 
Apple
 
back
 
for
 
their
 
ﬁrst
 
session,
 
they
 
get
 
to
 
kick-start
 
their
 
point
 
accumulation
 
for
 
the
 
Scholars
 
Store.
 
  
Scholars  Assessments  
Phonics  Assessment   The  Phonics  Assessment  is  designed  for  students  who  are  not  yet  reading  at  the  grade  four  level .  This  
assessment
 
focuses
 
on
 
the
 
following
 
areas:
 
letter
 
names
 
and
 
sounds,
 
short
 
vowels,
 
consonant
 
blends,
 
long
 
vowels,
 
consonant
 
digraphs,
 
vowel
 
digraphs,
 
r-controlled
 
vowels,
 
and
 
ﬁve
 
levels
 
of
 
sight
 
words.
 
The
 
assessment
 
allows
 
us
 
to
 
build
 
an
 
individualized
 
reading
 
program
 
for
 
students,
 
whether
 
that
 
be
 
Reading
 
Readiness
 
or
 
GAP-Reading.
 
  Note:  The  Phonics  Assessment  is  never  done  in  isolation.  It  is  also  a  starting  assessment  for  a  Reading  
Readiness
 
Assessment
 
or
 
a
 
CAT-3

  Level  Assignment  Chart  The  assessment  that  you  choose  for  each  student  is  very  important  in  order  to  generate  results  that  will  
accurately
 
depict
 
the
 
student’s
 
areas
 
of
 
strength
 
and
 
weakness.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
it
 
is
 
imperative
 
that
 
you

CAT-3  Reading,  Writing,  or  Math  Assessment  Administration:  ●  Follow  the  appropriate  level  Test  Directions  for  Teachers  and  ensure  that  the  time  limits  are  being  
enforced.
 ●  For  Levels  11-13,  the  assessor  sits  with  the  student  for  the  entirety  of  the  assessment.  ○  If  the  student  is  struggling  to  the  point  where  he/she  is  having  diﬃculty  reading  the  words  
at

However,
 
it’s

Chapter  5:  Assessments    Math  Transfer  of  Skills:  The  Transfer  of  Skills  (TOS)  sheet  is  a  tool  to  help  you  relay  pertinent  information  from  the  math  
assessment
 
to
 
the
 
parent,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
a
 
foundation
 
for
 
building
 
the
 
individualized
 
math
 
program
 
for
 
the
 
student.
 
Every
 
question
 
at
 
every
 
level
 
of
 
the
 
CAT-3
 
Mathematics
 
and
 
Computation
 
subtests
 
have
 
been
 
matched
 
with
 
the
 
appropriate
 
sub-concept(s)
 
in
 
our
 
math
 
program.
 
Therefore,
 
if
 
a
 
question
 
has
 
been
 
answered
 
incorrectly
 
on
 
the
 
assessment,
 
that
 
skill
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
incorporated
 
into
 
a
 
student’s
 
program.
 
  Complete  the  following  steps  to  determine  the  skill  gaps:   ▢  Select  the  correct  Transfer  of  Skills  level.   ▢  In  tab  1,  highlight  the  codes  to  any  questions  that  are  incorrect  on  the  answer  sheet.  ▢  In  tab  2,  highlight  the  codes  in  tab  2  that  were  highlighted  in  tab  1  in  their  ordered  list.  This  
provides
 
you
 
an
 
organized
 
summary
 
of
 
skill
 
gaps
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
ﬁve
 
strands
 
of
 
math
 
by
 
grade
 
level,
 
which
 
you
 
will
 
summarize
 
in
 
the
 
CAT-3
 
Math
 
Assessment
 
Record
 
and
 
also
 
use
 
when
 
creating
 
the
 
student’s
 
program.
 ▢  In  the  CAT-3  Math  Assessment  Record  -  Identiﬁed  Skill  Gaps  section,  include  the  grade  level  and  
the
 
total
 
number
 
of
 
skill
 
gaps
 
identiﬁed
 
in
 
each
 
strand
 
at
 
that
 
level

Chapter  5:  Assessments    
Sample  Comments  &  Next  Steps  
Comments  The  comments  section  of  any  Assessment  Record  should  give  a  succinct  summary  of  the  observations  
you
 
made
 
during
 
the
 
assessment.
 
The
 
comment
 
section
 
will
 
generally
 
not
 
include
 
any
 
speciﬁcs
 
about
 
what
 
the
 
student
 
had
 
diﬃculty
 
with
 
as
 
this
 
is
 
shown
 
in
 
the
 
result
 
chart(s)
 
themselves;
 
rather,
 
the
 
comment
 
section
 
should
 
focus
 
on
 
demonstrating
 
how
 
their
 
child
 
thinks
 
and
 
works.
 
  This  is  the  perfect  opportunity  to  further  establish  your  competence  and  credibility  by  tying  in  the  
parent’s
 
concerns
 
and
 
observations
 
shared
 
during
 
the
 
initial
 
inquiry
 
conversations
 
to
 
the
 
comments
 
from
 
the
 
assessment.
 
This
 
paragraph
 
is
 
generally
 
3-5
 
sentences
 
long.
  Sample  Comments:  
●  Although  _____  had  diﬃculty  with  some  of  the  phonics  subtests,  _____  persevered  and  always  
tried
 
their
 
best.
 
●  _____  rushed  through  their  assessment  and  did  not  use  all  of  the  available  time.  It  will  be  
important
 
for
 
_____
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
their
 
work
 
rather
 
than
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
questions
 
they
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
complete
 
quickly
 
moving
 
forward.
 
 
●  _____  was  very  eager  and  engaged  throughout  the  assessment!  It  is  clear  that  ____  enjoys  a  
challenge
 
and
 
embraces
 
it
 
completely.
 
●  _____  does  not  currently  hold  their  pencil  correctly,  which  is  likely  the  reason  they  are  
experiencing
 
fatigue
 
when
 
writing
 
and
 
a
 
lack
 
of
 
ﬁne
 
motor
 
control
 
when
 
colouring.
 
●  While  _____  ﬁnished  all  of  their  assessment  questions  before  the  allocated  time  was  up,  they  
used
 
the
 
extra
 
time
 
to
 
review
 
their
 
answers.
 
We
 
applaud
 
this
 
wonderful
 
habit!
 
●  Despite  scoring  well  in  the  mathematics  subtest,  _____  displayed  a  weakness  in  their  
computation
 
skills.
 
This
 
means
 
__________
 
has
 
been
 
relying
 
on
 
a
 
calculator
 
to
 
do
 
their
 
computations.
 
This
 
is
 
concerning
 
because
 
it
 
will
 
aﬀect
 
all
 
areas
 
of
 
math,
 
but
 
particularly
 
their
 
speed
 
when
 
completing
 
timed
 
tests
 
at
 
school.
 
 
Next  Steps  
The  next  steps  section  of  the  Assessment  Record  will  outline  the  plan,  establish  goals,  and  set  
expectations
 
for
 
the
 
student’s
 
program.

reading
 
program.
 
●  _____  program  will  focus  on  logically  and  sequentially  ﬁlling  in  the  skill  gaps  demonstrated  in  
the
 
assessment
 
so
 
they
 
can
 
catch
 
up
 
to
 
their
 
peers.
 
We
 
can
 
further
 
accelerate
 
their
 
progress
 
by
 
adding
 
an
 
additional
 
hour.
 
 
●  _____  program  will  build  on  their  phonics  strategy  of  diligently  breaking  apart  words  into  smaller  
components
 
to
 
increase
 
their
 
reading
 
comprehension
 
and
 
vocabulary.
 
●  During  _____’s  time  at  Scholars,  we  will  work  with  _____  to  become  more  conﬁdent/develop  
better
 
study
 
habits/improve
 
their
 
mental
 
math
 
skills.

work
 
on
 
a
 
variety
 
of
 
level-appropriate
 
activities
 
with
 
a

the
 
parent/guardian
 
would
 
like
 
to
 
see
 
the
 
assessment
 
results
 
prior
 
to
 
enrolling
 
(alternative),
 
the
 
Assessment
 
Review
 
Meeting
 
will
 
be
 
booked
 
as
 
soon
 
as
 
possible
 
after
 
the
 
assessment
 
or
 
even
 
at
 
the
 
beginning
 
of
 
their
 
ﬁrst
 
session
 
for
 
those
 
already
 
enrolled..
  Preparation:   Following  the  steps  found  in  Chapter  4:  Assessments,  you  will  have  already  generated  the  appropriate  Assessment  Record.    Schedule  a  30-minute  Assessment  Review  Meeting  with  the  family.    TIP:  Send  a  Google  Calendar  invite  to  conﬁrm  the  appointment  in  both  your  and  your  client’s  calendars.   Assessment  Review  Meeting:   Begin  every  Assessment  Review  Meeting  by  building  rapport  with  the  parent(s)/guardian(s)   Before  presenting  the  Assessment  Record,  ask  the  parent  what  their  child  shared  about  their  ﬁrst  experience  at  Scholars.    Place  the  Assessment  Record  in  front  of  the  parent(s)/guardian(s)   TIP:  Chunk  the  material  that  you  are  presenting  to  the  parent  by  covering  the  bottom  sections  and  revealing  section  by  section  to  ensure  they  are  focused  on  the  topic  of  
discussion.
  As  you  go  through  each  section,  ensure  that  the  parent  has  an  opportunity  to  ask  any  questions  they  may  have.   While  you  can  certainly  show  parent(s)/guardian(s)  examples  of  a  student's  work  or  the  questions  they  answered,  none  of  this  material  can  go  home  -  photocopies,  photos,  etc.    At  the  end  of  the  assessment  review  conversation,  both  yourself  and  the  parent(s)/guardian(s)  will  sign  the  bottom  of  the  Assessment  Record.

Chapter  6:  Assessment  Review  &  Enrollment  Meetings     For  those  who  have  enrolled  already ,  keep  the  original  for  the  student’s  ﬁle  on  location  and  send  a  copy  home  with  the  parent  -  either  a  physical  photocopy  or  an  email  scanned  copy.    If  sending  home  a  physical  copy,  this  will  go  into  the  Enrollment  Folder,  which  asks  as  the  family’s  ﬁle  folder  at  home  for  all  of  their  Scholars  reports  -  i.e.  Enrollment  Form,  
Assessment/Progress
 
Assessment
 
Records
 
and
 
Conference
 
Reports.
  For  those  who  haven’t  enrolled  yet ,  proceed  to  the  Enrollment  Meeting.   TIP:  As  the  assessment  is  completed  as  a  part  of  a  student’s  enrollment,  a  copy  of  the  Assessment  Record  will  go  home  once  the  student  has  completed  an  Enrollment  Form  
(IQ’s
 
Internal
 
Server
 
Documents
 
>
 
Operations
 
-
 
Enrollment
 
Documents).
  Best  Practices  ●  If  the  parent  insists  on  having  the  Assessment  Review  Meeting  in  the  Scholars  Online  Classroom  
or
 
over
 
the
 
phone,
 
have
 
the
 
discussion
 
ﬁrst.
 
 ○  In-person  or  voice-to-voice  conversations  will  always  yield  the  best  results  as  you  are  able  
to
 
clarify
 
any
 
questions
 
the
 
parent(s)/guardian(s)
 
may
 
have
 
in
 
live
 
time,
 
ensure
 
that
 
clear
 
expectations
 
and
 
goals
 
are
 
understood,
 
continue
 
to
 
build
 
the
 
rapport
 
needed
 
to
 
develop
 
competence
,
 
credibility
,
 
and
 
value
,
 
and
 
get
 
ahead
 
of
 
any
 
concerns
 
they
 
may
 
have
 
to
 
proactively
 
respond.
 ■  Note:  Assessment  Records  are  never  just  emailed  to  families  to  review  on  their  
own.
  
Enrollment  Meeting  
Before  enrolling  the  student  in  IQ,  every  family  will  meet  with  you  for  an  Enrollment  Meeting.  The  
purpose
 
of
 
this
 
meeting
 
is
 
to
 
ﬁnalize
 
the
 
student’s
 
recurring
 
schedule,
 
gather
 
pre-authorized
 
payment
 
information,
 
and,
 
most
 
importantly,
 
establish
 
expectations
 
with
 
Scholars
 
enrollment
 
policies.
  This  Enrollment  Meeting  will  take  place  in  one  of  two  ways:  ★  Preferred:   If  the  student  is  enrolled  on  the  assessment  day  -  after  you  shared  an  overview  of  the  student’s  
learning
 
skills
 
and
 
observed
 
performance
 
in
 
an
 
eﬀort
 
to
 
enroll
 
the
 
student
 
immediately
 
-
 
you
 
will
 
complete
 
the
 
Enrollment
 
Meeting
 
following
 
the
 
assessment.
 ●  TIP:  Ensure  you  always  give  yourself  enough  buﬀer  time  after  an  assessment  to  allow  for  
this
 
review
 
(approximately
 
30
 
minutes).

Chapter  6:  Assessment  Review  &  Enrollment  Meetings    ★  Alternative:  After  the  parent(s)/guardian(s)  have  engaged  with  you  during  the  Assessment  Review  Meeting,  
you
 
will
 
transition
 
into
 
the
 
Enrollment
 
Meeting.
 
 Preparation:   Prepare  a  copy  of  the  Enrollment  Form  (IQ’s  Internal  Server  Documents  >  Operations  -  Enrollment  Documents)   Schedule  a  30-minute  Assessment  Review  Meeting  with  the  family.    TIP:  Send  a  Google  Calendar  invite  to  conﬁrm  the  appointment  in  both  your  and  your  client’s  calendars.   Enrollment  Review  Meeting:   Place  the  Enrollment  Form  in  front  of  the  parent(s)/guardian(s)   TIP:  Chunk  the  material  that  you  are  presenting  to  the  parent  by  covering  the  bottom  sections  and  revealing  section  by  section  to  ensure  they  are  focused  on  the  topic  of  
discussion.
  As  you  go  through  each  section,  ensure  that  the  parent  has  an  opportunity  to  ask  any  questions  they  may  have  before  completing,  initialing,  or  signing.    Once  the  Enrollment  Form  is  completed,  keep  the  original  for  the  student’s  ﬁle  on  location  and  send  a  copy  home  with  the  parent  -  either  a  physical  photocopy  or  an  email  scanned  copy.    If  sending  home  a  physical  copy,  this  will  go  into  the  Enrollment  Folder,  which  asks  as  the  family’s  ﬁle  folder  at  home  for  all  of  their  Scholars  reports  -  i.e.  Enrollment  Form,

Chapter  6:  Assessment  Review  &  Enrollment  Meetings    
Team  Approach  Agreement  (Optional)  
The  fourth  page  of  the  Enrollment  Form  contains  our  optional  -  while  highly  recommended  -  Team  
Approach
 
Agreement.
 
By
 
completing
 
the
 
Team
 
Approach
 
Agreement,
 
it
 
gives
 
us
 
the
 
information
 
and
 
opportunity
 
to
 
attempt
 
to
 
connect
 
with
 
members
 
of
 
the
 
student’s
 
education
 
success
 
team.
  Unfortunately,  there  is  no  guarantee  that  the  member  of  the  student’s  education  success  team  will  
respond
 
-
 
as
 
they
 
are
 
not
 
obliged
 
to.
 
In
 
order
 
to
 
increase
 
your
 
chances
 
of
 
success,
 
here
 
are
 
a
 
few
 
best
 
practices:
  
★  Email  Most  of  the  time,  you  will  have  the  best  success  in  connecting  via  email.  When  emailing  a  
member
 
of
 
the
 
student’s
 
education
 
success
 
team,
 
always
 
maintain
 
a
 
professional
 
and
 
“oﬀering”
 
tone
 
-
 
i.e.,
 
you
 
are
 
not
 
just
 
“hunting”
 
for
 
information,
 
but
 
rather
 
are
 
also
 
oﬀering
 
valuable
 
information
 
and
 
insights
 
to
 
the
 
team
 
member,
 
along
 
with
 
sharing
 
some
 
highlights
 
of
 
our
 
programming
 
to
 
emphasize
 
the
 
value
 
of
 
our
 
services.
 
 ●  When  sending  an  email  to  a  member  of  the  student’s  education  success  team,  always  
include
 
a
 
scanned
 
copy
 
of
 
the
 
Team
 
Approach
 
Agreement
 
so
 
the
 
team
 
member
 
knows
 
that
 
you
 
have
 
received
 
direct
 
authorization
 
from
 
the
 
parent
 
for
 
parties
 
to
 
connect
 
and
 
share,
 
along
 
with
 
CCing
 
the
 
parent/guardian
 
to
 
the
 
email
 
as
 
well.
 
 ○  Sample  Email:   Hello  [Teacher’s  Name],   We  recently  completed  a  complimentary  [subject]  assessment/benchmarking  
session/trial
 
hour
 
for
 
[Student’s

and
 
they
 
have
 
enrolled
 
in
 
our
 
fabulous
 
[subject]
 
program
 
at
 
Scholars
 
of
 
[Location]!
 
  At  Scholars  of  [Location],  we  believe  in  a  Team  Approach  to  education.  We  work  
with
 
each
 
child’s
 
student’s
 
education
 
success
 
team
 
to
 
discuss
 
their
 
assessment
 
results,
 
learning
 
skills,
 
and
 
academic
 
performance
 
so
 
that
 
we
 
can
 
provide
 
personalized
 
support
 
at
 
Scholars.

Chapter  6:  Assessment  Review  &  Enrollment  Meetings    During  their  assessment/benchmarking  session/trial  hour,  we  observed…  (e.g.  their  
reading
 
comprehension
 
skills
 
are
 
currently
 
at
 
grade
 
3.2,
 
they
 
are
 
strong
 
at
 
decoding
 
unfamiliar
 
words,
 
but
 
they
 
lack
 
conﬁdence
 
in
 
the
 
words
 
that
 
they
 
do
 
know
 
and
 
break
 
apart
 
all
 
words,
 
which
 
impacts
 
their
 
ﬂuency,
 
etc.)
  Does  this  align  with  what  you  are  seeing  in  the  classroom?  Is  there  anything  else  
you’d
 
like
 
us
 
to
 
know?
 
Do
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
Google
 
Classroom
 
or
 
agenda
 
that
 
you
 
use
 
to
 
track
 
progress
 
and
 
upcoming
 
assignments?
 
 I’d  also  be  happy  to  connect  with  you  via  phone  if  that’s  your  preferred  method  of  
communication.
 
 
Yours  in  Education,  
 
[Director’s
 
Name]
 
★  Respect  Their  Time  
Hopefully,  you  have  a  great  ﬁrst  response  and  connection  with  the  student’s  education  success  
team
 
member!
 
Just
 
like
 
you,
 
student’s
 
education
 
success
 
team
 
members
 
are
 
busy,
 
so
 
it’s
 
important
 
to
 
respect
 
their
 
time
 
when
 
thinking
 
about
 
future
 
communications.
 
 
Rather  than  emailing  them  every  week  or  every  other  week,  consider  some  key  times  to  facilitate  
meaningful
 
touchpoints
 
-
 
i.e.
 
Scholars
 
conference
 
reports,
 
progress
 
assessment
 
completion,
 
school
 
reporting
 
periods,
 
etc.
 These  are  great  times  to  reconnect  to  reﬂect  on  the  child’s  
victories,
 
areas
 
of
 
growth,
 
and
 
to
 
get
 
updated
 
about
 
the
 
class’s
 
progress
 
at
 
school.

Chapter  7:  Programming     
The  Pre-Reading  Readiness  &  Reading  Readiness  
Programs
 
 
Program  Summary  The  new  Reading  Readiness  and  Pre-Reading  Readiness  programs  feature  multiple  levels,  which  start  at  
our
 
earliest
 
of
 
readers
 
to
 
logically
 
and
 
sequentially
 
scaﬀold
 
the
 
foundational
 
skills
 
necessary
 
to
 
become
 
a
 
successful
 
reader,
 
and
 
ﬂows
 
seamlessly
 
into
 
any
 
of
 
our
 
other
 
elementary
 
reading,
 
writing,
 
or
 
math
 
programs.
  Phonics:  
The  phonics  component  is  the  basis  of  our  program  and,  as  such,  has  been  fully  revamped  based  on  the  
frequency
 
of
 
letters
 
in
 
the
 
English
 
language
 
to
 
allow
 
students
 
to
 
learn
 
how
 
to
 
decode
 
words
 
instead
 
of
 
having
 
to
 
know
 
every
 
word
 
by
 
sight.
 
  The  student  will  work  on  assigned  exercises  for  each  subconcept  and  will  move  onto  the  next  
subconcept
 
once
 
the
 
mastery
 
criteria
 
has
 
been
 
met.
 
The
 
subconcepts
 
in
 
each
 
strand
 
are
 
integrated
 
as
 
well
 
so
 
students
 
don’t
 
work
 
through
 
an
 
entire
 
skill
 
level
 
from
 
start
 
to
 
ﬁnish
 
before
 
being
 
introduced
 
to
 
a
 
new
 
skill.
 
  This  strand  includes  multiple  opportunities  for  review  to  further  establish  proﬁciency  of  the  skills  when  
put
 
in
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
other
 
letters
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
deepens
 
their
 
retention
 
of
 
the
 
letters
 
and
 
sounds.
  Phonics  is  a  mandatory  component  of  both  the  Pre-Reading  Readiness  and  Reading  Readiness  
programs.
 
You
 
will
 
select
 
speciﬁc
 
concepts
 
for
 
this
 
component
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
results
 
of
 
the
 
Phonics
 
Assessment
 
and
 
students
 
will
 
be
 
assigned
 
subconcepts
 
sequentially.
 
  Sight  Vocabulary:  
Students  will  have  speciﬁc  sight  vocabulary  activity  pages  as  a  mandatory  component  to  their  program.  
As
 
such,
 
the
 
sight
 
word
 
list
 
from
 
IQ’s
 
Internal
 
Server
 
Documents
 
is
 
no
 
longer
 
required.
 
Sight
 
words
 
are
 
high-frequency
 
words
 
in
 
reading
 
that
 
a
 
student
 
should,
 
with
 
practice,
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
say
 
upon
 
seeing
 
(i.e.
 
without
 
needing
 
to
 
‘sound
 
them
 
out’).
 
Aside
 
from
 
being
 
high
 
frequency,
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
words
 
in
 
these
 
lists
 
do
 
not
 
follow
 
traditional
 
phonics
 
rules
 
students
 
are
 
being
 
taught
 
at
 
this
 
stage,
 
thereby
 
requiring
 
memorization.

  Comprehension:  
The  comprehension  activities  in  this  program  synchronize  with  the  phonics  and  sight  vocabulary  
concepts.
 
In
 
the
 
initial
 
levels,
 
students
 
focus
 
on
 
sound
 
patterns
 
with
 
the
 
most
 
frequent
 
consonants
 
and
 
short
 
vowels
 
and
 
work
 
up
 
to
 
an
 
introduction
 
of
 
reading
 
comprehension
 
skills
 
and
 
strategies
 
such
 
as
 
classiﬁcation
 
and
 
following
 
directions.
 
  Comprehension  is  a  mandatory  component  in  the  Reading  Readiness  program.  It  is  not  a  component  
of

-  et  Family  -  en  Family  -  et  &  -  en  Family  Review  
Vocabulary:   
The  vocabulary  component  ensures  that  the  student  can  read  levelled  words,  understand  what  the  
words
 
mean,
 
and
 
know
 
how
 
to
 
use
 
words
 
appropriately.
 
In

This
 
is
 
highly
 
recommended
 
for
 
students
 
who
 
need
 
to
 
develop
 
their
 
ﬁne
 
motor
 
skills
 
before
 
beginning
 
to
 
print
 
letters.
 
  Fine  Motor  is  a  mandatory  component  of  the  Pre-Reading  Readiness  program.  It  is  an  optional  
addition
 
to
 
the
 
Reading
 
Readiness
 
program.
 
You
 
will
 
select
 
speciﬁc
 
concepts
 
for
 
this
 
component
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
students
 
needs
 
and
 
students
 
will
 
be
 
assigned
 
subconcepts
 
sequentially.
 
  Printing:  
Our  brand  new  printing  program  is  scoped  and  sequenced  in  the  same  way  our  new  phonics  program  is  
-
 
based
 
on
 
frequency
 
of
 
letters
 
and
 
sounds.
 
This
 
means
 
that
 
our
 
early
 
readers
 
have
 
multiple
 
opportunities
 
to
 
read,
 
learn,
 
and
 
practice
 
these
 
letters.
 
Additionally,
 
we
 
are
 
introducing
  
sky,
 
grass,
 
dirt
 
imagery
 
and
 
letter
 
stories
 
to
 
act
 
as
 
cues
 
in
 
supporting
 
students
 
with
 
proper
 
letter
 
formation,
 
alignment
 
of
 
letters
 
on
 
primary
 
paper
 
lines,
 
and
 
beginning
 
formation
 
of
 
words
 
and
 
simple
 
sentences.
 
  Each  activity  page  will  last  two  sessions  so  that  students  practice  the  letter  in  the  ﬁrst  class  with  prompts  
and
 
guidance,
 
and
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
session,
 
they
 
practice
 
further
 
to
 
demonstrate
 
their
 
retention.
 
For
 
each
 
concept,
 
students
 
will
 
work
 
on
 
capital
 
formation
 
and
 
placement,
 
lowercase
 
formation
 
and
 
placement,
 
along
 
with
 
applying
 
these
 
formations
 
to
 
words
 
and
 
simple
 
sentences.
  Note:  In  IQ,  teachers  will  include  a  mark  for  the  page  after  both  session  activities  are  completed  as  
indicated
 
by
 
the
 
note
 
on
 
each
 
page.
 
  While  these  activities  are  uploaded  to  IQ  in  colour,  they  are  also  grey-scale  friendly.  Additionally,  to

Chapter  7:  Programming     
Number  Sense  and  Numeration:  
Numeration  is  the  understanding  of  numbers,  number  systems,  and  their  related  operations  (addition,  
subtraction,
 
multiplication,
 
and
 
division).
 A  well-developed  understanding  of  numbers  includes  a  grasp  of  not  only  counting  and  numeral  
recognition,
 
but
 
also
 
of
 
a
 
complex
 
system
 
of
 
more-than
 
and
 
less-than
 
relationships,
 
part-whole
 
relationships,
 
and
 
connections
 
between
 
numbers,
 
real
 
quantities,
 
and
 
measures
 
in
 
the
 
environment.
 Helping  students  to  understand  numbers  must  always  include  introducing  them  to  procedures  for  
accurately
 
performing
 
operations
 
with
 
numbers.
 
Students
 
need
 
to
 
develop
 
a
 
"number
 
sense”
 
by
 
mastering
 
key
 
facts
 
and
 
processes.
 
 
Measurement:  
Measurement  lends  itself  naturally  to  the  introduction  of  fractions  and  decimals.  It  also  requires  the  
student
 
to
 
be
 
actively
 
involved
 
in
 
solving
 
and
 
discussing
 
problems.
 
Students
 
compare
 
objects
 
directly
 
by
 
covering
 
them
 
with
 
various
 
units
 
and
 
counting
 
the
 
units.
 
As
 
students
 
develop
 
increasing
 
skills
 
in
 
numeration,
 
they
 
can
 
be
 
challenged
 
to
 
undertake
 
increasingly
 
complex
 
measurement
 
problems.
 Geometry  and  Spatial  Sense:  
Spatial  sense  is  the  intuitive  awareness  of  one's  surroundings  and  the  objects  in  them.  Geometry  helps  us  
represent
 
and
 
describe,
 
in
 
an
 
orderly
 
manner,
 
objects
 
and
 
their
 
interrelationships
 
in
 
space.
 
A
 
strong
 
sense
 
of
 
spatial
 
relationships
 
and
 
competence
 
in
 
using
 
the
 
concepts
 
and
 
language
 
of
 
geometry
 
can
 
improve
 
students’
 
understanding
 
of
 
number
 
and
 
measurement.
 Insights  and  intuitions  about  the  characteristics  of  two-dimensional  shapes  and  three-dimensional  objects,  
the
 
interrelationships
 
of
 
shapes,
 
and
 
the
 
eﬀects
 
of
 
changes
 
to
 
shapes
 
are
 
important
 
aspects
 
of
 
spatial
 
sense.
 
Patterning  and  Algebra:  
One  of  the  central  themes  in  mathematics  is  the  study  of  patterns  and  functions.  This  study  requires  a  
student
 
to
 
recognize,
 
describe,
 
and
 
generalize
 
patterns
 
and
 
to
 
build
 
mathematical
 
models
 
to
 
predict
 
the
 
behaviour
 
of
 
real
 
world
 
phenomena
 
that
 
exhibit
 
observed
 
patterns.
 
 Algebra  is  the  language  through  which  most  of  mathematics  is  communicated.  The  language  of  algebra  
can
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
generalize
 
a
 
pattern
 
or
 
a
 
relationship
 
or
 
as
 
a
 
problem-solving
 
tool;
 
it
 
is
 
a
 
means
 
of
 
clarifying
 
concepts
 
at
 
an
 
abstract
 
level
 
before
 
applying
 
them.

Chapter  7:  Programming     Data  Management  and  Probability:  
The  related  topics  of  probability  and  statistics  are  highly  relevant  to  everyday  life.  Graphs  and  statistics  
bombard
 
the
 
public
 
in
 
advertising,
 
opinion
 
polls,
 
reliability

by
 
scientists,
 
and
 
estimates
 
of

a
 
few.
 
It
 
includes,

to,
 
such
 
topics
 
as
 
ratios,
 
fractions,
 
percentages,
 
and
 
decimals.
 
Optional  -  Timed  Math  Drills:  
Timed  Math  Drills  are  activities  that  aim  to  increase  the  speed  and  accuracy  of  numeracy  and  arithmetic  
skills.
 
 
The  Prêt  à  lire  Program  
Program  Summary  Scholars  Prêt  à  lire  program  features  multiple  levels  of  components,  which  start  at  the  earliest  of  French  
linguists,
 
to
 
logically
 
and
 
sequentially
 
scaﬀold
 
the
 
skills
 
necessary
 
to
 
be
 
successful
 
in
 
French.
 
  La  phonétique  (phonics):   
Students  starting  to  learn  a  new  language  require  speciﬁc  and  dedicated  worksheets  for  phonics  
subconcepts.
 
The
 
student
 
will
 
work
 
on
 
assigned
 
exercises
 
for
 
each
 
subconcept
 
and
 
move
 
on
 
to
 
the
 
next
 
one
 
once
 
the
 
mastery
 
criteria
 
have
 
been
 
met.
 
The
 
subconcepts
 
in
 
each
 
strand
 
are
 
integrated
 
so
 
students
 
don’t
 
work
 
through
 
an

skill
 
level
 
from
 
start
 
to
 
ﬁnish
 
before
 
being
 
introduced
 
to
 
a
 
new
 
skill.

Hints  for  teachers:   ●  For  sounds  in  isolation,  the  majority  of  the  pictures  on  a  page  will  have  the  sound  ●  For  review  sets,  all  pictures  will  contain  one  of  the  sounds. 
Le  vocabulaire  (vocabulary):  
The  vocabulary  component  ensures  that  the  student  can  read  levelled  words,  understand  what  the  
words
 
mean,
 
and
 
know
 
how
 
to
 
use
 
words
 
appropriately.

Chapter  7:  Programming     Example:  Les  formes  ➡  Les  couleurs  ➡  Révision:  Les  formes  et  les  couleurs   Les  mots  courants  (sight  words):  
Another  aspect  of  this  program  is  sight  words.  Throughout  their  sessions  at  Scholars,  students  will  
continue
 
to
 
develop
 
their
 
proﬁciency
 
with
 
these
 
high-frequency
 
words.
 
Rather
 
than
 
reading
 
the
 
words
 
from
 
a
 
word
 
list,
 
this
 
program
 
contains
 
multiple
 
activities
 
for
 
each
 
word
 
list
 
for
 
a
 
student
 
to
 
demonstrate
 
mastery.
 
Example:  Liste  1  ➡  Liste  2  ➡  Revue:  Listes  1  &  2   Jouer  avec  les  mots  (word  play):  
Since  repetition  is  vital  when  learning  a  new  language,  this  course  component  provides  fun  and  
engaging
 
games
 
and
 
activities
 
for
 
students
 
to
 
further
 
practice
 
and
 
build
 
conﬁdence
 
with
 
the
 
words
 
they
 
are
 
learning
 
in
 
the
 
other
 
course
 
components
 
of
 
Prêt
 
à
 
lire.
 
Activities  include:  crossword  puzzles,  word  searches,  BINGO,  Go  Fish,  word  scrambles,  memory  games,  
etc.
 
Example:  Les  formes  ➡  Les  couleurs  ➡  Revue:  Les  formes  et  les  couleurs  
The  J’aime  le  français  Program  
Program  Summary  The  J’aime  le  français  program  seamlessly  transitions  from  our  Prêt  à  lire  program  and  features  multiple  
levels
 
of
 
components
 
to
 
logically
 
and
 
sequentially
 
scaﬀold
 
the
 
skills
 
necessary
 
to
 
be
 
successful
 
in
 
French.
 
  Le  vocabulaire  (vocabulary):  
The  vocabulary  component  ensures  that  the  student  can  read  levelled  words,  understand  what  the  
words
 
mean,
 
and
 
know
 
how
 
to
 
use
 
words
 
appropriately.

Chapter  7:  Programming     Example:  Les  voyelles  et  les  consonnes  ➡  L’ordre  alphabétique  ➡  Révision:  L’alphabet  La  grammaire  (grammar):  
Throughout  their  sessions  at  Scholars,  students  will  continue  to  develop  their  proﬁciency  with  isolated  
grammar
 
concepts.
 
Establishing
 
proﬁciency
 
with
 
grammar
 
allows
 
students
 
to
 
communicate
 
their
 
ideas
 
and
 
feelings
 
clearly
 
in
 
written
 
and
 
oral
 
communication.
 
Example:  Le  nom  commun  ➡  Le  nom  propre  ➡  Le  déterminant  ➡  Révision:  Les  noms  et  les  déterminants  L’écriture  (writing):  
With  the  foundations  of  phonics,  comprehension,  vocabulary,  and  grammar  established,  this  course  
component
 
provides
 
an
 
opportunity
 
for
 
students
 
to
 
not
 
only
 
gain
 
exposure
 
to
 
conventions,
 
forms,
 
and
 
style
 
when
 
writing
 
but
 
also
 
includes
 
continued
 
opportunities
 
to
 
demonstrate
 
their
 
proﬁciency
 
with
 
their
 
own
 
written
 
pieces.
 
Example:  La  majuscule  et  le  point  ➡  L’ordre  de  la  phrase  ➡  Révision:  La  phrase 
La  comprehension  en  lecture  (comprehension):  
The  comprehension  activities  in  this  program  focus  on  a  number  of  diﬀerent  subskills  organized  
sequentially,
 
from
 
foundation
 
skills
 
to
 
extension
 
skills.
 
This
 
section
 
allows
 
students
 
to
 
develop
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
not
 
only
 
decode
 
and
 
read
 
the
 
words
 
in
 
a
 
variety
 
of
 
texts
 
but
 
also
 
process
 
these
 
words
 
to
 
determine
 
meaning
 
from
 
the
 
texts.
 
  Example:  Mettre  en  ordre  ➡  Suivre  les  directives  ➡  ➡  ➡  La  cause  et  l’eﬀet  ➡  La  ﬁction  et  la  réalité  Optional  -  La  phonétique  (phonics):   
Students  starting  to  learn  a  new  language  require  speciﬁc  and  dedicated  worksheets  for  phonics  
subconcepts.
 
The
 
student
 
will
 
work
 
on
 
assigned
 
exercises
 
for
 
each
 
subconcept
 
and
 
move
 
on
 
to
 
the
 
next
 
one
 
once
 
the
 
mastery
 
criteria
 
have
 
been
 
met.
 
The
 
subconcepts
 
in
 
each
 
strand
 
are
 
integrated
 
so
 
students
 
don’t
 
work
 
through
 
an
 
entire
 
skill
 
level
 
from
 
start
 
to
 
ﬁnish
 
before
 
being
 
introduced
 
to
 
a
 
new
 
skill.

Hints  for  teachers:   ●  For  sounds  in  isolation,  the  majority  of  the  pictures  on  a  page  will  have  the  sound  ●  For  review  sets,  all  pictures  will  contain  one  of  the  sounds. 
Scholars  Program  Highlights  
●  Worksheets  are  the  anchoring  foundation  for  the  concept/skill,  and  are  built  to  reinforce  essential

 ○  TIP:  review  the  scoring  chart  from  the  Scholars  Teacher  Training  with  all  teachers  ●  Concepts  are  scaﬀolded  to  ensure  a  smooth  and  natural  progression  from  one  level  to  the  next.  ●  “Small”  and  “large”  reviews  throughout  each  component  ●  Cross-conceptual  integration   
Going  Beyond  
While  our  programs  are  inherently  cross-conceptual,  it’s  crucial  that  teachers  continue  to  enrich,  
enhance,
 
and
 
extend
 
beyond
 
the
 
worksheets
 
so
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
customized
 
and
 
individualized
 
for
 
each
 
student’s
 
speciﬁc
 
needs
 
and
 
goals.
 
  Consider:  ●  Manipulatives  ●  Whiteboard  work  
●  “Teach  the  teacher”  ●  Lots  of  oral  communication  extensions!

Chapter  7:  Programming     
Mastery  Learning   
Mastery  learning  is  an  instructional  approach  where  educational  progress  is  based  on  performance  
rather
 
than
 
time
 
spent.
 
Learners
 
are
 
given
 
multiple
 
opportunities
 
and
 
are
 
assessed
 
repeatedly
 
until
 
they
 
reach
 
the
 
required
 
mastery
 
level.
 
This
 
ﬁnal
 
level
 
of
 
achievement
 
remains
 
the
 
same
 
for
 
all,
 
but
 
the
 
time
 
to
 
master
 
it
 
can
 
vary.
  
At  Scholars,  students  in  our  proprietary  curriculum  programs  shared  above  achieve  mastery  of  a  concept  
when
 
they
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
achieve
 
100%
 
on
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
two
 
activities
 
or
 
four
 
activities
 
at
 
or
 
above
 
80%
.
 
They
 
then
 
progress
 
to
 
the
 
next
 
concept
 
within
 
that
 
skill.
 
It’s
 
important
 
to
 
note
 
that
 
mastery
 
does
 
not
 
imply
 
that
 
they
 
will
 
always
 
remember
 
that
 
concept
 
or
 
never
 
need
 
to
 
review
 
again;
 
it
 
simply
 
means
 
that,
 
at
 
that
 
time,
 
the
 
student
 
had
 
successfully
 
demonstrated
 
proﬁciency
 
with
 
the
 
concept.
  TIP :  The  Quick  Reference  Guide:  Mastery  Learning can  be  found  as  an  appendix  to  this  Playbook.   
High  School  Program  (LTT  -  Subject  -  Grade)  
Scholars  High  School  Program  is  designed  for  students  who  have  a  strong  foundation  in  all  of  their  basic  
skills
 
and
 
are
 
functioning
 
at,
 
or
 
close
 
to,
 
their
 
current
 
grade
 
level,
 
and
 
need
 
speciﬁc
 
subject
 
support.
 
This
 
program
 
allows
 
students
 
to
 
bring
 
in
 
their
 
own
 
textbooks
 
and
 
homework
 
from
 
school
 
and
 
have
 
guided
 
support
 
from
 
one
 
of
 
our
 
certiﬁed
 
teachers
 
or
 
qualiﬁed
 
mentors.
 
  During  the  sessions,  teachers  will  help  the  student  understand  and  apply  the  skills  required  to  work  
successfully
 
through
 
the
 
material.
 
This
 
program
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
for
 
any
 
subject,
 
so
 
long
 
as
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
qualiﬁed
 
teacher
 
available.
 
Instead
 
of
 
setting
 
up
 
a
 
speciﬁc
 
program,
 
the
 
students
 
ask
 
the
 
teacher/instructor
 
speciﬁc
 
questions
 
as
 
they
 
are
 
working
 
through
 
their
 
homework
 
or
 
assignment.
 
  In  addition  to  speciﬁc  subject  support,  the  Study  Skills  program  may  also  be  incorporated  into  high  
school
 
students’
 
lessons.
 
 
Study  Skills  Program  The  Study  Skills  Program  is  an  excellent  added  value  to  our  programs,  and  provides  skills  that  all  
students
 
can
 
beneﬁt
 
from.
 
If
 
this
 
subprogram
 
is
 
added
 
to
 
a
 
high
 
school
 
program,
 
students
 
should
 
spend
 
10-15
 
minutes
 
each
 
class
 
on
 
study
 
skills.
 
 
Throughout  this  program,  key  assignments  are  designed  to  introduce  students  to  fundamental  study  
skills
 
and
 
help
 
them
 
to
 
become
 
increasingly
 
more
 
conﬁdent
 
in
 
their
 
own
 
skills
 
and
 
strategies.

Chapter  7:  Programming     imperative  that  teachers  working  with  students  on  study  skills  transfer  the  strategies  and  skills  learned  at  
Scholars
 
to
 
the
 
work
 
the
 
student
 
is
 
currently
 
doing
 
in
 
the
 
classroom.
 
 
Some  of  the  topics  included  in  this  program  are:  ●  Goal  setting  ●  Learning  styles  ●  Time  management  ●  Organization  ●  The  study  environment  
●  Concentration  ●  Active  listening  ●  Memory  ●  Test  preparation  ●  Essay  writing   
Test  Preparation  (OTHER  -  S)  
From  time  to  time,  students  may  be  working  towards  additional  testing  beyond  their  traditional  high  
school
 
courses.
 
This
 
could
 
include
 
SAT,
 
ACT,
 
or
 
even
 
courses
 
like
 
pilot
 
training
 
or
 
real
 
estate
 
courses.
 
As
 
long
 
as
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
teacher
 
who
 
is
 
competent
 
and
 
conﬁdent
 
in
 
the
 
areas
 
the
 
student

support
 
on,
 
you
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
oﬀer
 
these
 
programs
 
at
 
your
 
location.
  In  all  cases,  students  who  wish  to  prepare  for  these  tests  are  encouraged  to  purchase  their  own  
preparation
 
books
 
from
 
their
 
local
 
bookstore
 
or
 
online
 
since
 
it
 
is
 
crucial
 
that
 
they
 
also
 
be
 
practicing
 
their
 
skills
 
outside
 
of
 
Scholars
 
to
 
achieve
 
the
 
results
 
they
 
are
 
looking
 
for.
  
GED/CAEC  GED®  
The  GED  is  an  international  testing  program  for  adults  who  have  been  unable  to  complete  high  school.  
The
 
GED
 
measures
 
the
 
level
 
of
 
“educational
 
maturity”
 
gained
 
through
 
experience,
 
which
 
is
 
often
 
equal
 
to,
 
or
 
above,
 
the
 
level
 
of
 
a
 
high
 
school
 
graduate.
  The  GED  test  covers  ﬁve  core  high  school  curriculum  areas:  math,  science,  social  studies,  language  arts  -  
reading,
 
and
 
language
 
arts
 
-
 
writing.
 
 
CAEC  
As  of  May  3,  2024,  the  General  Education  Development  (GED®)  high  school  equivalency  program   is  no  longer  available  in  Canada.  The  new  Canadian  Adult  Education  Credential  (CAEC) has  replaced  the  GED®.

education
 
qualiﬁcation
 
as
 
a
 
replacement
 
for
 
the

The
 
CAEC
 
is
 
for

who
 
do
 
not
 
have
 
a

opportunities.
 
  While  the  test  is  the  same  across  the  country,  please  review  your  local  provincial  website  for  more  information  about  how  your  province  will  be  oﬀering  this  course.  For  example,  in  Ontario,  interested  individuals  will  register  for  this  course  via  TVO  Independent  Learning  Centre  (ILC),  but  Alberta follows  a  diﬀerent  registration  process.   Supporting  at  Scholars  
Before  beginning  to  work  on  GED/CAEC  preparation,  students  must  ﬁrst  complete  the  CAT-3  Level  18  
reading,
 
writing,
 
and
 
math
 
assessments.
 
They
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
meet
 
a
 
minimum
 
grade
 
equivalency
 
of
 
9.0
 
to
 
start
 
directly
 
into
 
their
 
GED/CAEC
 
preparation;
 
otherwise,
 
you
 
will
 
enroll
 
them
 
into
 
an
 
elementary
 
reading,
 
writing,
 
and/or
 
math
 
program
 
to
 
ﬁll
 
in
 
the
 
gaps
 
ﬁrst
 
and
 
foremost
 
so
 
they
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
access
 
the
 
preparation
 
material.
 
 
SAT,  ACT,  etc.  
Before  beginning  their  sessions,  students  preparing  for  SAT,  ACT,  or  the  like  should  begin  by  completing  
a
 
practice
 
test
 
at
 
your
 
location
 
under
 
testing
 
conditions
 
(quiet
 
testing
 
room,
 
time
 
restrictions
 
in

etc.)
 
before
 
their
 
ﬁrst
 
session.
 
This
 
“assessment”
 
would
 
be
 
complimentary
 
just
 
as
 
with
 
all
 
of
 
our
 
other
 
assessments.
 
Test  d’évaluation  de  français  (TEF)   
The  Test  d’évaluation  de  français  (TEF)  is  an  internationally  recognized  exam  that  assesses  French  
proficiency
 
for
 
immigration,
 
citizenship,
 
and
 
professional
 
purposes.
 
The
 
TEF
 
Canada
 
is
 
specifically
 
required
 
by
 
Immigration,
 
Refugees
 
and
 
Citizenship
 
Canada
 
(IRCC)
 
for
 
those
 
applying
 
for
 
permanent
 
residency
 
or
 
citizenship.
 
The
 
test
 
evaluates
 
four
 
key
 
skills:
 
listening,
 
speaking,
 
reading,
 
and
 
writing,
 
with
 
a
 
scoring
 
system
 
aligned
 
with
 
the
 
Canadian
 
Language
 
Benchmarks
 
(CLB).
 
Understanding
 
the
 
TEF
 
structure
 
is
 
essential
 
to
 
supporting
 
many
 
adult
 
French
 
students!
 
Best  Practices  for  Program  Planning  1.  French  Benchmarking  Session  -  Using  these  assignment  worksheets  as  the  foundation,  your  
teacher
 
will
 
determine
 
students'
 
strengths
 
and
 
weaknesses
 
(i.e.
 
comprehension,
 
vocabulary,

Chapter  7:  Programming     grammar,  writing,  and  oral  and  aural  competencies).  After  the  French  Benchmarking  Session,  set  
clear
 
expectations
 
based
 
on
 
their
 
existing
 
proﬁciencies.
 2.  Structure  Lessons  Around  TEF  Components  –  During  each  session,  focus  consistently  on  
developing
 
the
 
four
 
areas
 
of
 
the
 
TEF:
 
1)
 
listening,
 
2)
 
speaking,
 
3)
 
reading,
 
and
 
4)
 
writing.
 3.  Set  Score-Based  Milestones  –  Develop  a  study  plan  with  measurable  goals  based  on  students’  
required
 
CLB
 
levels.
 4.  Use  Authentic  Test  Materials  –  Incorporate  past  exams  and  sample  questions  to  familiarize  students  with  test  formats.   5.  Prioritize  Speaking  and  Listening  –  Since  oral  comprehension  and  expression  are  heavily  
weighted,
 
dedicate
 
extra
 
practice
 
time
 
to
 
these
 
areas.
 6.  Simulate  Test  Conditions  –  Schedule  mock  exams  under  timed  conditions  to  improve  conﬁdence  
and
 
time
 
management.
 7.  Encourage  Daily  French  Immersion  —  To  reinforce  skills  outside  of  lessons,  recommend  French  
media,
 
conversation
 
practice,
 
and
 
reading.

in
 
two
 
formats:
 
Academic,
 
usually
 
for
 
those
 
applying
 
to
 
universities
 
and
 
higher
 
education
 
institutions,
 
and
 
General
 
Training,
 
for
 
individuals
 
seeking
 
work,
 
training,
 
or
 
migration
 
opportunities.
 
Achieving
 
a
 
high
 
IELTS
 
score
 
can
 
significantly
 
impact
 
educational
 
and
 
career
 
prospects,
 
making
 
thorough
 
preparation
 
essential
 
for
 
test-takers.
 
Adult
 
ESL
 
students
 
will
 
often
 
contact
 
Scholars
 
for
 
support
 
with
 
IELTS
 
preparedness.
 
Best  Practices  for  Program  Planning  1.  Assessment  –  Based  on  the  inquiry  call,  determine  the  student’s  English  proﬁciency.  No  matter  
the
 
level
 
of
 
English
 
proﬁciency,
 
choose
 
an
 
assessment
 
level
 
that
 
aligns
 
with
 
their
 
self-reported
 
English
 
knowledge.
 
In
 
addition
 
to
 
their
 
assessment
 
results,
 
have
 
the
 
student
 
converse
 
(generally)
 
with
 
the
 
assessor
 
to
 
determine
 
their
 
strengths
 
in
 
writing,
 
listening,
 
and
 
speaking.
 
After
 
this
 
initial
 
assessment,
 
set
 
clear
 
expectations
 
based
 
on
 
their
 
existing
 
proﬁciencies.
 
 2.  Structure  Lessons  Around  IELTS  Components  –  During  each  session,  focus  consistently  on  
developing
 
the
 
four
 
areas
 
of
 
the
 
IELTS:
 
listening,
 
speaking,
 
reading,
 
and
 
writing.
 
Be
 
sure
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
the
 
“weak
 
areas,”
 
monitor
 
success,
 
and
 
allocate
 
extra
 
time
 
to
 
sections
 
where
 
the
 
student
 
needs
 
more
 
support.

Chapter  7:  Programming     3.  Use  Authentic  Test  Materials  –  Incorporate  practice  exams  and  sample  questions  from  either  the  Academic or  the  General  Training tests.  Use  these  materials  to  guide  your  sessions.  4.  Encourage  Daily  English  Immersion  –  Promote  speaking,  listening,  reading,  and  writing  at  home  
through
 
real-life
 
interactions
 
and
 
media.
 
 5.  Simulate  Test  Conditions  –  Schedule  mock  exams  under  timed  conditions  to  improve  conﬁdence  
and
 
time
 
management.
 
Student  Binder  Assembly  
1.  Print  a  Student  Binder  Cover  Insert  in  colour  (IQ’s  Internal  Server  Documents  >  Operations  -  
Binder
 
Documents)
 
with
 
the
 
student’s
 
ﬁrst
 
name
 
and
 
last
 
initial,
 
and
 
place
 
it
 
in
 
the
 
front
 
cover
 
pocket.
 2.  Print  the  appropriate  coloured  Scholars  Binder  Spine   (IQ’s  Internal  Server  Documents  >  
Operations
 
-
 
Binder
 
Documents)
 
with
 
the
 
student’s
 
ﬁrst
 
name
 
and
 
last
 
initial,
 
and
 
place
 
it
 
in
 
the
 
spine
 
pocket.
 3.  Use  the  following  chart  to  assemble  the  rest  of  the  binder  based  on  the  student’s  program.  ●  Note :  If  a  student  is  enrolled  in  two  diﬀerent  programs,  they  should  have  two  binders  to  
avoid
 
any
 
confusion.

Chapter  7:  Programming     
Course  Creation  in  IQ  
For  elementary  students,  you  will  use  the  results  from  their  assessment(s)  to  build  the  student’s  
individualized
 
coursework
 
for
 
their
 
program
 
as
 
per
 
the
 
following
 
chart
 
and
 
examples.
 
 
For  students  who  have  completed  a  CAT-3  assessment,  you  will  use  their  grade  equivalency  to  
determine
 
their
 
starting
 
point.
 
For
 
example,
 
a
 
student
 
who
 
scored
 
at
 
a
 
grade
 
equivalent
 
2.2
 
on
 
Reading
 
and
 
Language
 
would
 
start
 
at
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
subskill
 
for
 
Comprehension
 
Level
 
2.
 
Whereas,
 
a
 
student
 
who
 
scored
 
at
 
a
 
grade
 
equivalent
 
of
 
3.7
 
on
 
Vocabulary
 
would
 
start
 
at
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
subskill
 
for
 
Vocabulary
 
Level
 
4.
 
If
 
a
 
student
 
scores
 
at
 
a
 
.5
 
level,
 
the
 
assessor
 
may
 
use
 
their
 
discretion
 
to
 
round
 
up
 
or
 
down
 
in
 
program
 
level.
 
All
 
in
 
all,
 
students
 
should
 
only
 
ever
 
be
 
starting
 
at
 
the
 
beginning
 
of
 
a
 
level
 
or
 
halfway
 
through.
 
For  students  who  scored  at  a  grade  equivalent  above  their  current  grade,  they  would  begin  at  the  next  
“half-step”
 
level.
 
For
 
example,
 
a
 
student
 
in
 
5.5
 
who
 
scored
 
above
 
their
 
current
 
grade
 
equivalency
 
would
 
begin
 
their
 
program
 
at
 
Level
 
6.
 
All  in  all,  students  should  only  ever  be  starting  at  the  beginning  of  a  level  or  halfway  through  a  level.

Chapter  8:  Retention     
 
Eﬀective  Retention  Strategies  
Retention  starts  from  the  very  ﬁrst  conversation  you  have  with  a  parent!    
Inquiry  The  initial  conversation  with  the  parent  has  an  immense  underlying  correlation  to  retention.  1.  Did  we  establish  a  positive  rapport  with  the  parent?  2.  Did  we  ask  enough  questions  to  understand  their  core  concern?  3.  Did  we  discuss  topics  beyond  academics,  including  conﬁdence  level,  self-esteem,  independence  
skills,
 
homework
 
situation,
 
and
 
how
 
they
 
feel
 
about
 
school?
 4.  Most  importantly,  did  we  ask  the  parent  what  their  expectations  are?    
Assessment  Review   The  assessment  review  is  an  opportunity  to  really  connect  with  the  parent  and  establish  a  relationship.  1.  Are  we  just  providing  results  from  their  child’s  assessment  or  are  we  explaining  why  it  matters?  2.  Based  on  the  expectations  of  the  parent  stated  during  the  initial  inquiry,  are  they  realistic?  3.  Are  we  discussing  conferences  and  why  it’s  important  to  come  in  and  have  these  meetings?  4.  Was  the  Team  Approach  Agreement  mentioned  and  why  it’s  important  to  work  together  to  reach  
a
 
child’s
 
educational
 
goals?
   
Programming  If  a  student  is  engaged,  enjoys  coming  and  sees  the  beneﬁts,  they  will  continue  attending.  1.  Ensuring  that  each  student  is  put  on  the  right  program  that  it  is  going  to  challenge  them  is  vital  to  
retention.
 
At
 
no
 
point
 
should
 
the
 
program
 
be
 
“easy”.
 2.  Are  teachers  empowered  to  give  feedback  regarding  student’s  needs?  3.  Is  reassessing  being  done  accordingly?  4.  Are  conferences  being  completed  on  time?    
Teachers   Not  only  are  they  critical  to  retention;  they  contribute  to  the  overall  success  of  your  location.  1.  Did  we  pair  the  student  with  the  teacher  we  think  they  will  work  best  with?  2.  Are  teachers  establishing  a  positive  rapport  with  the  student?  3.  Are  we  having  conversations  with  teachers  to  make  sure  it’s  the  right  ﬁt  and  also  assessing  the  
table
 
dynamic?
 4.  Are  we  following  up  with  the  parent  after  a  few  sessions  to  see  how  their  child  is  ﬁnding  Scholars  
and
 
their
 
teacher?

The  Standard  Conference  
After  every  12  hours  of  instruction,  prepare  for  the  conference  meeting.  Every  conference  meeting  is  
focused
 
on
 
sharing
 
insights
 
from
 
the
 
last
 
12
 
sessions
 
and
 
setting
 
the
 
stage
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
12
 
sessions
.
 
  Pre-Reading  Readiness,  Reading  Readiness,  elementary  reading,  writing,  or  math,  and  Prêt  à  lire  and

conferences
 
are
 
generated
 
directly
 
within

template
 
is
 
found
 
in
 
the
 
Scholars

folder.
  
Conference  Reports  Preparation:   Schedule  a  30-minute  Assessment  Review  Meeting  with  the  family.    TIP:  Send  a  Google  Calendar  invite  to  conﬁrm  the  appointment  in  both  your  and  your  client’s  calendars.   On  IQ’s  main  dashboard,  you  will  ﬁnd  the  Conference  Reminders  list.  Review  this  list  on  a  weekly  basis  (i.e.  every  Friday)  to  stay  in  touch  with  the  conferences  that  are  coming  due.   Note :  IQ  will  add  the  student’s  name  to  your  Conference  Reminders  list  two  sessions  before  the  conference  is  due  -  i.e.  a  12-hour  conference  will  be  added  to  the  list  at  the  10  
hour
 
mark
 
-
 
to
 
give
 
you
 
approximately
 
a
 
week
 
to
 
prepare
 
the
 
conference
 
report.
  Once  a  student’s  name  has  been  added  to  the  Conference  Reminders  list,  focus  the  upcoming  week  on  actively  reviewing  the  student’s  binder,  observing  their  sessions,  and  reviewing  their

the
 
student
 
has
 
mastered
 
since
 
the

  Note:  For  LTT  or  OTHER  programs,  you  will  utilize  the  framework  in  the  High  School  Conference  Report  template  found  in  the  Scholars  Google  Drive  Documents  folder.   You  will  add  two  note  blocks  by  selecting  ‘Add  Notes’  -  one  note  block  will  be  labelled  Comments:  and  the  second  note  block  will  be  labeled  Next  Steps :  like  in  the  Assessment  
Record.
  Include  appropriate  comments  and  next  steps  in  the  student’s  conference  notes  blocks  -  see  Sample  Comments  and  Next  Steps.

Chapter  8:  Retention     Conference  Meeting:   Begin  every  conference  by  building  rapport  with  the  parent(s)/guardian(s)   Before  presenting  the  conference  report  you’ve  generated  from  IQ  already,  ask  the  parent  for  updates  from  school,  what  their  child  has  shared  with  them  recently  about  attending  Scholars,  
etc.
  Place  the  conference  report  in  front  of  the  parent(s)/guardian(s)   TIP:  Chunk  the  material  that  you  are  presenting  to  the  parent  by  covering  the  bottom  sections  and  revealing  section  by  section  to  ensure  they  are  focused  on  the  topic  of  
discussion.
  As  you  go  through  each  section,  ensure  that  the  parent  has  an  opportunity  to  ask  any  questions  they  may  have.   While  you  can  certainly  show  parent(s)/guardian(s)  examples  of  a  student's  work,  none  of  this  material  can  go  home  -  photocopies,  photos,  etc.    NOTE :  At  the  end  of  the  conference  report  is  a  legend  summarizing  the  mastery  learning  “marks”.  You  can  ﬁnd  more  information  about  this  information  in  the  Quick  Reference  Guide:  Mastery  Learning found  as  an  appendix  to  this  Playbook.   At  the  end  of  the  conference  conversation,  both  yourself  and  the  parent(s)/guardian(s)  will  sign  the  bottom  of  the  conference  report.   Keep  the  original  for  the  student’s  ﬁle  on  location  and  send  a  copy  home  with  the  parent  -  either  a  physical  photocopy  or  an  email  scanned  copy.    Best  Practices  ●  Prepare  for  every  12-hour  conference  to  keep  the  information  in  sync  and  then  schedule  the  
meeting
 
with
 
parents
 
from
 
there.
 
 ○  Pre-scheduling  keeps  everything  on  track  -  i.e.  at  the  12-hour  conference,  schedule  a  time  
for
 
the
 
24-hour
 
conference
 
and
 
then
 
at
 
the
 
24-hours
 
conference,
 
schedule
 
a
 
time
 
for
 
the
 
36-hour
 
reassessment
 
and
 
conference.
 
 ●  It  is  usually  easiest  to  schedule  the  conferences  during  the  student’s  regularly  scheduled  class  
time
 
or
 
in
 
a
 
slot
 
adjacent
 
to
 
this
 
time.
 
Scheduling
 
conferences
 
during
 
the
 
student’s
 
session
 
ensures
 
the
 
parents
 
will
 
not
 
have
 
to
 
make
 
another
 
trip
 
to
 
the
 
location
 
and
 
will
 
be
 
more
 
likely
 
to
 
attend.
 
 ○  If  the  parent  insists  on  having  the  conference  in  the  Scholars  Online  Classroom  or  over  
the
 
phone,
 
have
 
the
 
discussion
 
ﬁrst
 
and
 
then
 
email
 
them
 
a
 
copy
 
of
 
the
 
conference
 
report.
 
 ○  In-person  or  voice-to-voice  conversations  will  always  yield  the  best  results  as  you  are  able  
to
 
clarify
 
any
 
questions
 
the
 
parent(s)/guardian(s)
 
may
 
have
 
in
 
live
 
time,
 
ensure
 
that
 
clear
 
expectations
 
and
 
goals
 
are
 
understood
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
12
 
sessions,

Chapter  8:  Retention     rapport  needed  to  develop  competence ,  credibility ,  and  value ,  and  get  ahead  of  any  
concerns

 `  
The  Reassessment  Conference  
In  addition  to  the  standard  conference  report,  after  every  36  hours  of  instruction,  students  in  Pre-Reading  
Readiness,
 
Reading
 
Readiness,
 
or
 
elementary
 
reading,
 
writing,
 
or
 
math
 
programs
 
are
 
also
 
reassessed.
 
This
 
reassessment
 
is
 
also
 
complimentary
 
and
 
scheduled
 
in
 
addition
 
to
 
their
 
regularly
 
scheduled
 
tutoring
 
sessions.
 
  Ensure  the  student  is  set  up  for  success  for  the  progress  assessment.  The  assessment  circumstances  
should
 
be
 
similar
 
to
 
the
 
initial
 
assessment.
 
If
 
the
 
initial
 
assessment
 
was
 
completed
 
ﬁrst
 
thing
 
in
 
the
 
morning,
 
the
 
progress
 
assessment
 
should
 
not
 
be
 
after
 
school
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
day.
  For  Pre-Reading  Readiness  or  Reading  Readiness  programs,  the  student  will  complete  the  Phonics  
Assessment
 
and
 
Reading
 
Readiness
 
Assessment
 
once
 
again,
 
except
 
in
 
the
 
case
 
where
 
they
 
have
 
moved
 
onto
 
level
 
one
 
materials
 
in
 
their
 
lessons.
 
In
 
this
 
case,
 
you
 
would
 
administer
 
the
 
Phonics
 
Assessment
 
and
 
CAT-3
 
Assessment
 
as
 
you
 
would
 
with
 
any
 
other
 
student
 
who
 
is
 
no
 
longer
 
reading
 
below
 
the
 
grade
 
1
 
level.
  For  elementary  reading,  writing,  or  math,  a  student’s  ﬁrst  36-hour  reassessment  will  be  assessed  using  
the
 
same
 
level
 
assessment
 
as
 
was
 
previously
 
administered,
 
and
 
marked
 
according
 
to
 
the
 
assessment
 procedures  outlined  in  Chapter  4:  Assessments.  If  the  student  is  still  working  on  the  same  program  at  the  72-hour  mark,  you  would  complete  the  appropriate  level  CAT-3  assessment  for  that  current  grade  and  
point
 
in
 
the
 
year.
 
  After  completing  the  progress  assessment,  prepare  the  progress  report  by  using  the  appropriate  
Progress
 
Assessment
 
Record
 
template
 
(Scholars
 
Google
 
Drive
 
Documents
 
>
 
Assessment
 
Records).
 
After
 
entering
 
the
 
student’s
 
initial
 
assessment
 
results,
 
ﬁll
 
in
 
the
 
progress
 
assessment
 
results.
 
On
 
Reading
 
Readiness
 
and
 
1-3
 
Writing
 
Progress
 
Assessment
 
Records,
 
you
 
will
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
share
 
the
 
growth
 
with
 
a
 
side-by-side
 
comparison.
 
For
 
CAT-3
 
Progress
 
Assessment
 
Records,
 
you
 
will
 
calculate
 
the
 
growth
 
by
 
subtracting
 
the
 
initial
 
assessment
 
grade
 
equivalency
 
results
 
from
 
the
 
progress
 
assessment
 
grade
 
equivalency
 
results,
 
and
 
include
 
this
 
grade
 
equivalency
 
improvement
 
in
 
the
 
growth
 
column.

Chapter  8:  Retention     For  all  CAT-3  assessments,  you  will  add  the  progress  assessment  grade  equivalencies  for  each  subtest  
reassessed
 
to
 
the
 
student’s
 
proﬁle
 
on
 
IQ.
  
Sample  Comments  &  Next  Steps  
Comments  The  comments  section  of  any  conference  report  should  give  a  succinct  and  highly-personalized  
summary
 
of
 
the
 
observations
 
you
 
made
 
during
 
the
 
student’s
 
last
 
12
 
sessions.
 
The
 
comment
 
section
 
will
 
generally
 
not
 
include
 
any
 
speciﬁcs
 
about
 
what
 
the
 
student
 
had
 
diﬃculty
 
with
 
as
 
this
 
is
 
shown
 
in
 
the
 
concepts
 
mastered
 
chart(s)
 
themselves;
 
rather,
 
the
 
comment
 
section
 
should
 
focus
 
on
 
demonstrating
 
how
 
their
 
child
 
has
 
grown
 
in
 
their
 
skills,
 
strategies,
 
and
 
habits
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
12
 
sessions.
 
  Consider:  ●  Learning  skills  -  i.e.,  responsibility,  organization,  self-regulation,  focus,  independent  work,  
initiative,
 
collaboration
 
and
 
sociability,
 
openness/eagerness
 
to
 
seek
 
challenges,
 
openness
 
to
 
accepting
 
teacher
 
feedback,
 
understanding
 
classroom
 
expectations
 
(e.g.,
 
staying
 
seated,
 
inside
 
voice,
 
etc.),
 
etc.
 ●  Areas  of  strength  -  i.e.,  phonemic  awareness,  ﬁne  motor,  oral  or  written  communication,  etc.  ●  Eﬀective  strategies  -  i.e.,  reading,  writing,  or  math  concept  strategies,  study  skill  strategies,  etc.    This  is  the  perfect  opportunity  to  further  establish  your  competence  and  credibility  by  tying  in  the  
parent’s
 
concerns
 
and
 
observations
 
shared
 
during
 
previous
 
conversations.
 
This
 
paragraph
 
is

  Sample  Comments:  
●  _____  has  been  working  diligently  at  understanding  classroom  expectations,  including  _____ .   
●  _____  eﬀectively  applies  reading  strategies  like  stretching,  chunking,  and  blending  
independently.
 
●  _____  uses  an  eﬃcient  pencil  print  to  print  letters  with  increased  precision  and  legibility.  
●  _____  beneﬁts  from  hands-on  manipulatives,  including  _____ ,  that  engage  their  visual  and  tactile  
learning
 
styles.

Chapter  8:  Retention     
●  _____  has  also  completed  regular  writing  exercises  where  they  work  through  the  stages  of  the  
writing
 
process
 
(e.g.,
 
brainstorming,
 
drafting,
 
editing,
 
publishing)
 
involved
 
in
 
diﬀerent
 
types
 
of
 
writing
 
(e.g.,
 
narrative,
 
persuasive,
 
etc.).
 
●  _____  beneﬁts  from  graphic  organizers  and  other  brainstorming  aids  for  inspiration  in  the  
brainstorming
 
and
 
drafting
 
stages
 
of
 
the
 
writing
 
process.
  
Next  Steps  
The  next  steps  section  of  the  conference  report  will  outline  the  highly-personalized  plan,  establish  
goals,
 
and
 
set
 
expectations
 
for
 
the
 
student’s
 
program.
 
In
 
the
 
end,
 
this
 
section
 
should
 
not
 
only
 
focus
 
on
 
the
 
student’s
 
academic
 
goals,
 
but
 
also
 
demonstrate
 
how
 
Scholars
 
programs
 
will
 
support
 
their
 
skills,
 
strategies,
 
and
 
habits
 
for
 
life-long
 
skills
 
-
 
a
 
key
 
retention
 
tool
 
as
 
well.
 
This

the
 
areas
 
for
 
improvement
 
and
 
goals.
 ●  TIP :  If  the  student  is  only  attending  once  a  week  per  subject,  explain  how  their  areas  of  growth  
can
 
be
 
addressed
 
by
 
full-time
 
enrollment.
 ●   TIP:  If  the  summer  months  are  nearing,  explain  how  their  areas  of  growth  can  be  addressed  by  
summer
 
learning
 
(e.g.,
 
No
 
better
 
time
 
to
 
keep
 
up,
 
catch
 
up,
 
or
 
get
 
ahead!)
  Sample  Next  Steps:  
●  In  the  next  12  hours,  _____  will  be  working  to  eﬀectively  apply  reading  strategies  like  stretching,  
chunking,
 
and
 
blending
 
independently.
 
●  In  the  next  series  of  sessions,  we  will  support  _____  to  use  an  eﬃcient  pencil  print  to  print  letters  
with
 
increased
 
precision
 
and
 
legibility.

foundations
 
to
 
decode
 
more
 
complex
 
unfamiliar
 
words.
 
●  Moving  forward,  we  encourage  _____  to  _____.  
●  We  are  dedicated  to  supporting  the  development  of  _____'s  skill  in  _____ .  
●  To  ensure  retention  over  the  summer,  we  encourage  _____’s  to  continue  to  attend  sessions  twice  
a
 
week
 
so
 
they
 
can
 
enter
 
the
 
school

Exit  Notice  When  a  parent  notiﬁes  the  location  they’re  withdrawing  their  child  from  the  program,  it  is  important  to  
understand
 
why
 
they’re
 
exiting
 
rather
 
than
 
simply
 
saying
 
“OK”
 
and
 
writing
 
down
 
their
 
exit
 
date.
  Be  honest  with  the  parent  if  you  strongly  feel  the  child  shouldn’t  exit.  In  some  instances,  you  may  help  a  
parent
 
realize
 
exiting
 
may
 
not
 
be
 
the
 
best
 
option
 
for
 
their
 
child.
 
Having
 
this
 
conversation
 
may
 
shed
 
light
 
on
 
something
 
simple
 
as
 
a
 
schedule
 
change
 
or
 
program
 
modiﬁcation
 
to
 
help
 
prevent
 
the
 
exit.
 
  Parents  will  often  want  to  exit  for  some  of  the  following  reasons:  1.  The  program  is  too  challenging  2.  The  program  is  too  easy  3.  Financial  reasons  4.  The  child  doesn’t  want  to  come  anymore  5.  The  child  doesn’t  like  their  teacher  6.  They  have  found  an  alternative  tutor  7.  We  have  not  met  their  expectations   After  speaking  with  the  parent  and  understanding  their  reasons  for  wanting  to  exit,  if  you  are  not  able  to  
provide
 
a
 
solution
 
to
 
address
 
this
 
concern,
 
always
 
recommend
 
that
 
the
 
parent
 
come
 
in
 
for
 
an
 
Exit
 
Conference.
 
Use
 
this
 
opportunity
 
to
 
discuss
 
initial
 
assessment
 
results
 
and
 
their
 
child’s
 
progression.
  
During
 
this
 
time
 
you
 
can
 
also
 
share
 
any
 
ﬁnal
 
feedback
 
from
 
the
 
student’s
 
teacher
 
and,
 
if
 
the
 
child
 
is
 
exiting
 
on
 
good
 
terms,
 
now
 
is
 
the
 
perfect
 
time
 
to
 
ask
 
for
 
them
 
to
 
leave
 
a
 
review
 
or
 
if
 
they
 
know
 
anyone
 
else
 
Scholars
 
could
 
help.

Chapter  9:  Seasonal  Preparation    
Summer  Preparation  
This  section  includes  everything  you  need  to  run  a  fun,  engaging  summer  in  your  location.  It  has  been  
designed
 
to
 
chronologically
 
walk
 
you
 
through
 
the
 
steps
 
involved
 
in
 
promoting
 
summer
 
at
 
your
 
location.
  Your  focus  for  summer  should  always  be  increasing  the  frequency  of  regular  student  programs  since  
summer
 
is
 
the
 
perfect
 
time
 
for
 
students
 
to
 
catch
 
up,
 
keep
 
up,
 
and
 
even
 
get
 
ahead
 
before
 
the
 
next
 
school
 
year
 
begins
 
with
 
increased
 
ﬂexibility
 
while
 
school
 
is
 
not
 
in
 
session!
  
Summary  As  demonstrated  time  and  time  again,  our  top  performing  locations  during  the  summer  focus  on  
continuing
 
with
 
their
 
regular
 
tutoring
 
programming
 
with
 
a
 
focus
 
on
 
alternative
 
and
 
ﬂexible
 
scheduling
 
with
 
an
 
individualized
 
approach
 
demonstrating
 
how
 
Scholars
 
can
 
support
 
their
 
child[ren]
 
over
 
the
 
summer
 
months
 
-
 
all
 
starting
 
at
 
least
 
three
 
months
 
before
 
the
 
summer
 
starts!
  Alternatively,  in  addition  to  regular  programming,  you  can  oﬀer  Scholars  week-long  half-day  summer  
programming
 
to
 
fulﬁll
 
a
 
need
 
in
 
your
 
community.
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
“gateway”
 
to
 
a
 
regular
 
tutoring
 
program.
 
Note:
 
it
 
does
 
have
 
a
 
lower
 
proﬁt
 
margin
 
and
 
your
 
competition
 
increases
 
as
 
it
 
is
 
not
 
only
 
tutoring
 
companies
 
who
 
enter
 
the
 
summer
 
camp
 
space
 
-
 
i.e.
 
sports
 
organizations,
 
community
 
camps,
 
etc.
  Be  Proactive   
Families  need  to  know  that  our  programs  run  year-round  and  that  we  oﬀer  ﬂexibility  to  balance  their  
summer
 
schedule,
 
but,
 
more
 
importantly,
 
for
 
them
 
to
 
understand
 
the
 
value
 
of
 
summer
 
learning
 
and
 
the
 
progress
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
made
 
when
 
students
 
aren’t
 
in
 
the
 
classroom.
 
You
 
can
 
lose
 
a
 
signiﬁcant
 
amount
 
of
 
your
 
student
 
base
 
for
 
the
 
summer
 
by
 
not
 
being
 
proactive.
 
Parents
 
often
 
fall
 
under
 
the
 
assumption
 
that
 
classes
 
at
 
Scholars
 
only
 
take
 
place
 
during
 
the
 
ten
 
months
 
that
 
students
 
are
 
in
 
school,
 
and
 
unless
 
we
 
tell
 
them
 
otherwise,
 
we
 
are
 
not
 
at
 
the
 
forefront
 
of
 
their
 
minds
 
when
 
they
 
are
 
making
 
their
 
summer
 
plans.
 
  Waiting  for  your  clients  to  inform  you  of  their  plans  for  summer  is  not  ideal  because  they  often  want  their  
child
 
to
 
“take
 
a
 
break”
 
from
 
learning,
 
and
 
once
 
they
 
set
 
their
 
summer
 
schedule,
 
they
 
don’t
 
want
 
to—and
 
may
 
not
 
be
 
able
 
to—move
 
things
 
around
 
to
 
accommodate
 
Scholars.
 
Being
 
proactive
 
in
 
ﬁguring
 
out
 
who
 
will
 
attend
 
and
 
when
 
will
 
allow
 
you
 
to
 
understand
 
your
 
staﬃng
 
needs
 
and
 
manage
 
staﬃng
 
costs.
 
  If  you  are  a  new  location  or  have  fewer  than  75  students  enrolled ,  you  will  want  to  focus  your  schedule  
in
 
your
 
traditional
 
evening
 
hours
 
-
 
from
 
4-8
 
pm
 
-
 
to
 
maintain
 
control
 
of
 
your
 
bottom
 
line
 
through
 
optimized
 
table-tightness
 
ratios
 
and
 
teacher
 
costs.
 
If
 
you
 
ﬁnd
 
that
 
your
 
evening
 
spaces

Chapter  9:  Seasonal  Preparation    there  is  interest  for  early  times,  you  can  start  working  your  way  earlier  in  the  schedule  an  hour  at  a  time  -  
i.e.
 
3-8
 
pm,
 
then
 
2-8
 
pm,
 
etc.
 
  If  you  are  a  location  that  has  more  than  75  students  enrolled  and  there  is  interest  from  some  of  your  
clients,
 
the
 
summer
 
is
 
the
 
perfect
 
time
 
to
 
provide
 
additional
 
schedule
 
ﬂexibility
 
for
 
families
 
by
 
oﬀering
 
some
 
morning
 
classes.
 
  Increasing  the  Frequency  of  Student  Hours  
You  can  mitigate  any  revenue  loss  by  increasing  the  frequency  of  your  summer  clients.  Using  this  
method,
 
you
 
can
 
compensate
 
for
 
the
 
lost
 
revenue
 
and
 
even
 
surpass
 
it!
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
100
 
clients
 
coming
 
in
 
two
 
hours
 
per
 
week
 
and
 
lose
 
35
 
of
 
those
 
clients,
 
you’ve
 
lost
 
70
 
student
 
hours
 
per
 
week.
 
But,
 
if
 
35
 
of
 
your
 
existing
 
65
 
clients
 
(i.e.
 
just
 
over
 
half)
 
increase
 
their
 
frequency
 
by
 
two
 
hours
 
per
 
week,
 
you
 
have
 
made
 
up
 
your
 
lost
 
revenue.
 
The
 
best
 
way
 
to
 
ensure
 
increased
 
frequency
 
is
 
to
 
begin
 
talking
 
about
 
it
 
with
 
your
 
current
 
clients
 
as
 
early
 
as
 
possible,
 
consistently
 
promote
 
the
 
beneﬁts
 
of
 
increasing
 
frequency
 
during
 
summer,
 
and
 
collect
 
clients’
 
summer
 
schedules.
 
Additional  Possibilities  
Themed  Weeks  Themes  are  an  easy,  inexpensive  way  to  ensure  that  all  students  who  attend  during  the  summer  months  
-
 
especially
 
those
 
who
 
may
 
not
 
be
 
overly
 
keen
 
on
 
attending
 
over
 
the
 
summer
 
-
 
have
 
a
 
fun,
 
memorable
 
week!
 
Staﬀ
 
and
 
students
 
can
 
dress
 
up
 
according
 
to
 
the
 
theme,
 
and
 
you
 
can
 
choose
 
to
 
incorporate
 
simple
 
and
 
inexpensive
 
decorations.
 
You
 
can
 
even
 
have
 
weekly
 
contests
 
to
 
encourage
 
participation
 
in
 
the
 
theme
 
week.
 
Choose
 
an
 
appropriate
 
theme
 
for
 
all
 
students
 
to
 
participate
 
in
 
and
 
carry
 
that
 
through
 
for
 
the
 
entire
 
week.

Scholars  Week-Long  Half-Day  Programming  Some  locations  may  be  inclined  to  oﬀer  a  host  of  camps  during  the  summer  to  compete  with  other  
businesses

oﬀering
 
camps.
 
Ultimately,
 
we

Chapter  9:  Seasonal  Preparation    students  are  in  higher  ratio  groups  with  little  personalization  and  limited  capability  to  oﬀer  any  academic  
support.
 
  While  Scholars  Day  Camps  provide  an  excellent  opportunity  to  oﬀer  accelerated  programming  to  existing  
and
 
future
 
“traditional”
 
tutoring
 
students
 
while
 
engaging
 
them
 
in
 
our

-
 
all
 
while
 
providing
 
a
 
safe
 
and
 
welcoming
 
environment
 
for
 
students
 
to
 
spend
 
half-days
 
for
 
a
 
week
 
at
 
a
 
time,
 
this
 
program
 
does
 
have
 
a
 
lower
 
proﬁt
 
margin
 
than
 
regular
 
programming
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
lower
 
hourly
 
rates.
  If  you  choose  to  run  a  summer  camp  based  on  an  evident  need  for  the  families  in  your  community,  
remember
 
that
 
these
 
camps
 
should
 
be
 
no
 
longer
 
than
 
half-day
 
(i.e.
 
morning
 
or
 
afternoon)
 
and
 
should
 
not
 
include
 
a
 
lunch
 
break
 
to
 
avoid
 
potential
 
licensing
 
issues.

Act,

when
 
considering
 
alternative
 
camp
 
structures
.
 
For
 
example,
 
day
 
camps
 
in
 
Ontario
 
serving
 
children
 
who
 
are
 
younger
 
than
 
four
 
years
 
of
 
age
 
require
 
a
 
child
 
care
 
licence.
 
This
 
places
 
an
 
emphasis
 
on
 
protections
 
and
 
standards
 
for
 
young
 
children
 
as
 
they
 
are
 
a
 
more
 
vulnerable
 
population.
 
Preparing  for  the  Summer  Beginning  at  least  three  months  before  summer  starts ,  it’s  time  to  hyper-focus  on  summer  in  every  
conference,
 
phone
 
conversation,
 
email,
 
and
 
interaction
 
with
 
your
 
clients
 
and
 
prospective
 
clients
 
-
 
although
 
summer
 
should
 
be
 
discussed
 
in
 
every
 
enrollment
 
conversation
 
no
 
matter
 
what
 
time
 
of
 
the
 
year
 
it
 
is!
 
  The  goal  is  to  ensure  clients  know  that  summer  means  “business  as  usual”  at  Scholars  and  is  a  great  
opportunity
 
to
 
catch
 
up,
 
keep
 
up,
 
and
 
get
 
ahead
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
school
 
year.
 
You
 
want
 
to
 
receive
 
summer
 
schedules
 
as
 
soon
 
as
 
possible
 
so
 
you
 
know
 
your
 
potential
 
revenue
 
for
 
the
 
summer
 
months
 
and
 
to
 
allow
 
for
 
adequate
 
staﬃng.
 
Tips  for  Selling  Summer  1.  Remind  clients  to  provide  their  summer  schedules  —  the  earlier,  the  better  ●  Run  in-location  promotions  that  encourage  students  to  bring  in  their  summer  schedules  ○  Example:  “Bring  in  your  summer  schedule  by  May  1  to  receive  25  bonus  stamps!”

Chapter  9:  Seasonal  Preparation    ○  TIP :  Submit  a  Marketing  Request  for  a  location-speciﬁc  summer  schedule  calendar  or  
create
 
a
 
Google
 
Form
 
to
 
collect
 
schedule
 
information.
  2.  Encourage  accelerated/intensive  programs   ●  Accelerated/intensive  programs  mean  students  attend  more  hours  per  week  during  the  summer.  
These
 
accelerated
 
programs
 
can
 
be
 
particularly
 
useful
 
for
 
catching
 
up
 
with
 
remedial
 
students
 
before
 
the
 
new
 
school
 
year
 
so
 
they
 
can
 
start
 
at
 
grade
 
level
 
and
 
with
 
more
 
conﬁdence
 
in
 
their
 
knowledge
 
and
 
abilities.
 
 ○  You  can  oﬀer  summer  “incentive”  pricing  to  reward  families  who  attend  more  than  eight  
classes/month.
 
For
 
example:
 
 ■  Minimum  of  8  classes/month  =  $400  ($50/hr)  ■  Minimum  of  12  classes/month  =  $570  ($47.50/hr  -  5%  savings)  ■  Minimum  of  16  classes/month  =  $720  ($45/hr  -  10%  savings)  ●  Encourage  families  to  schedule  two-hour  sessions  when  they  know  there  will  be  breaks  in  the  
student’s
 
summer
 
schedule.
 
For
 
example,
 
24
 
hours
 
can
 
be
 
completed
 
in
 
just
 
12
 
two-hour
 
sessions
 
in
 
the
 
70
 
days
 
during
 
the
 
summer
 
months.
 
Similarly,
 
48
 
hours
 
can
 
be
 
completed
 
in
 
just
 
24
 
two-hour
 
sessions,
 
making
 
it
 
easy
 
to
 
accommodate
 
a
 
week
 
at
 
the
 
cottage
 
or
 
other
 
times
 
the
 
student
 
might
 
be
 
away.
   3.  Promote  the  beneﬁts  of  additional  programs   ●  Study  skills  programs  are  ideal  for  students  entering  high  school  or  post-secondary.  They  help  
with
 
transitions
 
and
 
ensure
 
students
 
have
 
the
 
skills
 
they
 
need
 
to
 
succeed.
 ●  Enrichment  programs  provide  a  good  transition  for  next  year,  which  results  in  a  more  conﬁdent  
child
 
in
 
September.
 ●  Scholars  classes  are  great  for  children  transitioning  into  grade  one,  where  they  will  have  to  sit  for  
longer
 
periods
 
in
 
a
 
“traditional”
 
classroom
 
environment.
 
 ●  Reach  out  to  previous  summer  students,  exited/on  hold  students,  and  leads  to  promote  Scholars’  
summer
 
programs.
 
Director  Talking  Points  ●  “Since  information  and  skills  need  to  be  consistently  repeated  to  be  retained  long-term,  students  
lose,
 
on
 
average,
 
at
 
least
 
one
 
month’s
 
worth
 
of
 
school-year
 
learning.
 
This
 
loss
 
is
 
even
 
greater
 
with
 
math
 
skills.”
 ○  “This  means  that  in  the  12  years  Canadian  students  spend  in  school,  12  months  (over  one  
school
 
year)
 
is
 
dedicated
 
to
 
reteaching
 
and
 
relearning
 
concepts
 
and
 
skills
 
forgotten
 
over
 
the
 
summer
 
break.”
 ●  “We  understand  that  summer  is  a  busy  time,  and  we  will  work  around  your  child’s  unique  
schedule
 
to
 
ensure
 
they
 
receive
 
the
 
learning
 
they
 
need
 
to
 
catch
 
up,
 
keep
 
up,
 
or
 
get
 
ahead.”

Chapter  9:  Seasonal  Preparation    ○  “16  hours  is  only  1%  of  your  summer!”  ●  “Students  love  summer  learning,  especially  those  who  enroll  in  our  accelerated  programs!  
Summer
 
is
 
a
 
stress-free
 
time
 
to
 
learn
 
because
 
students
 
don’t
 
have
 
competing
 
homework
 
assignments,
 
student-teacher
 
tensions,
 
classroom
 
distractions,
 
school
 
sports
 
teams,
 
or
 
other
 
school-related
 
frustrations
 
and
 
distractions.”
 ●  “Summer  is  the  best  time  to  catch  up,  as  it  is  easier  to  close  the  gap  when  other  concepts  and  
skills
 
are
 
not
 
moving
 
forward.”
 
Summer  Timeline  Every  location’s  summer  plan  will  be  customized  to  meet  the  needs  of  your  clients  and  community,  but  
following
 
the
 
outline
 
below
 
will
 
ensure
 
you
 
are
 
on
 
track
 
for
 
a
 
well-planned,
 
successful,
 
and
 
proﬁtable
 
summer.
 
What’s
 
important
 
is
 
that
 
you
 
are
 
proactive
 
in
 
encouraging
 
current,
 
non-enrolled,
 
on-hold,
 
and
 
exited
 
students
 
to
 
attend
 
-
 
don’t
 
wait
 
for
 
them
 
to
 
come
 
to
 
you!
 
Four  Months  Ahead  of  Summer  ▢  Set  your  location’s  summer  goals.  ▢  Send  a  general  email  to  all  enrolled  clients  via  the  steps  outlined  in  the  Marketing  Guide  via  a  
Marketing
 
Request
 
informing
 
them
 
that
 
the
 
location
 
will
 
be
 
open
 
for
 
the
 
summer.
 
Include
 
the
 
summer
 
programs
 
and
 
availability
 
you
 
are
 
oﬀering.
 ▢  Choose  weekly  themes  and  send  in  Marketing  Form  Requests  for  themed  marketing  materials.  
Three  Months  Ahead  of  Summer  ▢  Discuss  the  value  of  attending  over  the  summer  and  the  beneﬁts  of  accelerated  programming  
during
 
all
 
conferences
 
and
 
to
 
all
 
newly
 
enrolled
 
students.
 ▢  Explain  to  your  staﬀ  (especially  tutors)  their  role  in  promoting  summer  learning  at  Scholars  while  
at
 
the
 
teaching
 
tables
 
-
 
you
 
can
 
even
 
add
 
this
 
as
 
a
 
Course
 
Note
 
in
 
IQ.
 ▢  Assess  the  number  of  conﬁrmed  students  and  the  staﬃng  needs  when  considering  all  scheduled  
absences,
 
extra
 
classes,
 
and
 
additional
 
programs
 
oﬀered.
 
 ▢  Speak  with  current  staﬀ  and  determine  who  would  like  to  work  and  any  vacation  plans  they  may  
have
 ▢  Post  for  available  positions  if  required.  ▢  Call  and  email  current,  exited/on-hold,  and  unenrolled  leads  to  invite  them  to  attend  Scholars  this  
summer.
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
great
 
time
 
to
 
catch
 
up
 
with
 
clients
 
and
 
be
 
at
 
the
 
top
 
of
 
mind
 
when
 
report
 
cards
 
are
 
released
 
in
 
June.
 
 ▢  As  you  receive  summer  schedules,  keep  IQ  updated  so  you  are  organized  heading  into  summer.

Chapter  9:  Seasonal  Preparation    
Two  Months  Ahead  of  Summer  ▢  Post  all  summer  marketing  materials  in  the  lobby.  ▢  Hold  a  staﬀ  meeting  to  discuss  summer.   ▢  Begin  calling  current  clients  who  have  not  yet  conﬁrmed  their  schedule  for  the  summer.  If  parents  
are
 
still
 
unsure
 
of
 
their
 
plans,
 
set
 
up
 
a
 
follow-up
 
call
 
in
 
your
 
Google
 
Calendar.
 
The  Month  Before  Summer  Starts  ▢  For  any  current  students  who  have  not  conﬁrmed  a  schedule,  follow-up  with  parents.  
Summer  ▢  Make  plenty  of  social  media  posts  regarding  STEM,  the  themed  weeks,  and  the  fun  of  summer  
learning!
 ▢  Ensure  you  have  a  mid-summer  conference  with  each  of  your  clients  around  late  July  or  early  
August.
 
 ○  The  goals  of  this  conference  are:  1.  to  discuss  the  student’s  progress  made  thus  far  in  the  summer,   2.  to  discuss  the  student’s  goals  for  the  rest  of  the  summer,  and   3.  to  encourage  clients  to  commit  to  continuing  into  the  fall  by  showing  them  the  
value
 
of
 
continuing
 
with
 
Scholars
 
into
 
the
 
school
 
year.
 Note:  There  is  no  need  to  have  clients  complete  another  Enrollment  Form  for  the  fall.  
Simply
 
adjust
 
their
 
schedule
 
in
 
IQ
 
and
 
conﬁrm
 
with
 
them
 
by
 
sending
 
them
 
an
 
email.
 
Start  of  a  New  School  Year  ▢  Set  some  time  aside  during  your  last  L10  of  the  summer  or  the  ﬁrst  L10  of  the  new  school  year  to  
reﬂect
 
on
 
summer.
 
It’s
 
easier
 
to
 
think
 
about
 
these
 
things
 
right
 
after
 
summer
 
when
 
everything
 
is
 
fresh
 
rather
 
than
 
waiting
 
until
 
next
 
spring.
 
Consider
 
the
 
following
 
questions:
 ○  What  went  well?  ○  What  didn’t  go  well?  ○  Did  you  meet  your  summer  student,  revenue,  or  service  hour  goals?  ○  What  will  you  need  to  change  to  make  next  summer  more  successful?

Scholars  Half-Day  Camp  Program  
The  Scholars  Half-Day  Camp  Program  provides  an  excellent  opportunity  to  oﬀer  accelerated  
programming
 
to
 
existing

“traditional”
 
tutoring
 
students,
 
while
 
engaging
 
them
 
in
 
our
 
LEGO
 
STEM
 
program
 
-
 
all
 
while
 
providing
 
a
 
safe
 
and
 
welcoming
 
environment
 
for
 
students
 
to
 
spend
 
half-days
 
for
 
a
 
week
 
at
 
a
 
time.
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
great
 
feeder
 
program
 
for
 
our
 
traditional
 
after-school
 
tutoring,
 
so
 
don’t
 
forget
 
to
 
discuss
 
it
 
with
 
parents
 
as
 
well!
 
It's  important  that  we  continue  to  deliver  an  exceptional  Scholars  experience  with  this  program,  and  show  
clients
 
how
 
Scholars
 
is
 
diﬀerent
 
and
 
goes
 
above
 
and
 
beyond.
 
From
 
the
 
continued
 
small
 
class
 
sizes
 
to
 
our
 
Assessment
 
and
 
Enrollment
 
Meetings,
 
providing
 
a
 
high-quality

will
 
ensure
 
your

are
 
successful
 
and
 
lead
 
to
 
referrals
 
and
 
a
 
continued
 
positive
 
reputation
 
in
 
your
 
community.
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
unique
 
opportunity
 
to
 
support
 
families
 
in
 
your
 
community,
 
so
 
ensure
 
you
 
make
 
the
 
most
 
of
 
it!
 
The  half-day  camp  program  outlined  below  is  pre-approved  for  immediate   
use
 
at
 
any
 
location.
 
If
 
you
 
have
 
other
 
ideas
 
for
 
your
 
camp,
 
we’re
 
here
 
to
 
listen!
 
Please
 
share
 
your
 
ideas
 
with
 
the
 
Operations
 
Team
 
before
 
sharing
 
 
or
 
requesting
 
any
 
marketing
 
collateral.
 
Organizing  Camp  “Pods”  
Each  group  of  students  and  teacher(s)  will  form  their  own  pod .  When  organizing  each  pod,  consider  the  
grade
 
levels
 
and
 
subject
 
areas
 
of
 
the
 
students.
 
We
 
recommend
 
grouping
 
students
 
in
 
Grades
 
K-2,
 
Grades
 
3-5,
 
and
 
Grades
 
6-8
 
to
 
align
 
with
 
the
 
grade
 
recommendations
 
in
 
the
 
LEGO
 
kits.
 
Ratios  &  Teachers  
This  program  will  be  run  at  a  3:1  student-to-teacher  ratio.  Just  like  your  regular  programming,  you  will  
want
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
teacher
 
who
 
is
 
assigned
 
to
 
each
 
pod
 
is
 
conﬁdent
 
and
 
competent
 
with
 
Scholars
 
programming
 
for
 
each
 
student
 
and
 
the
 
LEGO
 
Education
 
curriculum.
 
The
 
3:1
 
ratio
 
shows
 
new
 
clients
 
exactly
 
what
 
to
 
expect
 
in
 
any
 
of
 
our
 
year-long
 
traditional
 
programming,
 
which
 
leads
 
to
 
an
 
easier
 
transition
 
and
 
retention
 
of
 
new
 
students.
 
This
 
also
 
allows
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
run
 
this
 
program
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time
 
as
 
any
 
other
 
regularly
 
scheduled
 
students
 
during
 
your
 
daytime
 
hours.
 
Pricing  ●  We  suggest  $400/week  for  half-days,  Monday  -  Friday.  This  price  is  a  suggestion  -  each  centre  
can
 
choose
 
their
 
price
 
point
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
research
 
conducted
 
on
 
their
 
local
 
market.
 
However,
 
a
 
few
 
notes
 
to
 
consider:

Chapter  9:  Seasonal  Preparation    ○  While  this  is  potentially  more  than  other  community-based  programs,  we  are  ultimately  
not
 
trying
 
to
 
compete
 
with
 
them.
 
At
 
Scholars,
 
students
 
are
 
receiving
 
three
 
hours
 
of
 
individualized,
 
accelerated,
 
low
 
student-to-teacher
 
ratio
 
programming
 
plus
 
engaging
 
STEM
 
activities
 
every
 
day
 
for
 
only
 
$80!
 
At
 
other
 
community-based
 
programs,
 
students
 
are
 
in
 
higher
 
ratio
 
groups
 
with
 
little
 
personalization
 
and
 
limited
 
capability
 
to
 
oﬀer
 
any
 
academic
 
supports.
 ○  In  the  end,  for  every  week  of  half-day  programming,  students  are  receiving  10  hours  of  
academic
 
support
 
with
 
ﬁve
 
hours
 
of
 
STEM
 
-
 
that
 
is
 
more
 
than
 
one
 
month
 
of
 
traditional
 
programming
 
in
 
just
 
one
 
week!
  
Assessment  &  Enrollment  
All  new  students  who  enroll  in  this  program  are  assessed  so  you  can  better  understand  their  learning  
strengths
 
and
 
weaknesses.
 
This
 
will
 
help
 
the
 
teachers
 
when
 
working
 
with
 
the
 
students,
 
while
 
also
 
allowing
 
you
 
to
 
promote
 
the
 
traditional
 
tutoring
 
support
 
outside
 
of
 
their
 
camp
 
week(s).
 
  Note:  it  is  strongly  recommended  that  new  students  attend  a  minimum  of  two  weeks  focusing  on  a  
single
 
subject
 
so
 
you
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
truly
 
demonstrate
 
the
 
value
 
of
 
our
 
program
 
and
 
have
 
the
 
student
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
make
 
signiﬁcant
 
progress
 
towards
 
their
 
goals.
  All  students  in  Day  Camp  will  have  the  same  paperwork  on  ﬁle:  Student  Information  Form  and  Enrollment  
Form.
 
  
Sample  Half-Day  Schedule   
1:00  pm  -  1:50  pm  
Scholars  Program  -  Part  1  Students  work  on  their  Reading  Readiness  or  GAP  program.    
1:50  pm  -  2:10  pm  
Break  Activity  Students  will  bring  a  healthy  snack  with  them.  While  eating  their  snack,  they  will  engage  in  a  short  activity  of  the  teacher’s  choosing  based  on  the  age  level  and  interests  of  the  pod.  Some  ideas  are  listed  in  the  Break  Activities  section  below.  
2:10  pm  -  3:00  pm  
Scholars  Program  -  Part  2  Students  continue  working  on  their  Reading  Readiness  or  GAP  program.  If  a  student  is  enrolled  in  two  full-time  programs  outside  of  the  camp,  they  could  switch  to  their  second  program  for  this  section  as  well.

Chapter  9:  Seasonal  Preparation    
3:00  pm  -  4:00  pm  
LEGO  STEM  Session  At  the  beginning  of  the  week,  select  a  unit  that  is  appropriate  for  the  age  and  ability  level  of  each  pod.  Using  the  pre-established  unit  and  lesson  plans  (Quick  Reference  Guide  for  each  LEGO  kit  available  in  IQ’s  Internal  Server  Documents  >  STEM),  the  teacher  will  guide  students  through  a  unit  throughout  the  week.  
IQ  
When  enrolling  a  student  in  a  Scholars  Day  Camp,  you  will  enroll  and  schedule  their  hours  based  on  their  
program(s)
 
for
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
two
 
hours
 
and
 
then
 
enroll
 
and
 
schedule
 
the
 
third
 
hour
 
as
 
STEM
.
 
Note:  in  IQ,  the  functionality  exists  to  create  another  recurring  schedule  at  a  diﬀerent  rate,  which  allows  
for
 
ease
 
in
 
scheduling
 
students
 
who
 
are
 
attending
 
both
 
a
 
traditional
 
tutoring
 
program
 
and
 
a
 
Day
 
Camp
 
program.
 
Break  Activities  When  selecting  break  activities  for  your  classes,  consider  including  a  variety  of  activities  over  the  course  
of
 
the
 
week,
 
e.g.
 
some
 
physical
 
activities,
 
some
 
science-based
 
activities,
 
some
 
virtual
 
tours,
 
etc.
 
This
 
will
 
keep
 
the
 
students
 
engaged
 
even
 
during
 
their
 
downtime.

Chapter  10:  Human  Resources    
Human  Resources  
A  location’s  teaching  staﬀ  is  one  of  the  most  important  factors  to  every  location’s  success.  As  a  result,  it  
is
 
crucial
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
positive
 
work
 
environment
 
where
 
your
 
staﬀ
 
feels
 
empowered
 
to
 
make
 
decisions,
 
raise
 
concerns,
 
and
 
are
 
free
 
to
 
provide
 
feedback.
 
  
Steps  to  Building  a  Positive  Environment  ▢  Develop  relationships:  Get  to  know  your  staﬀ  beyond  their  qualiﬁcations.  Spend  the  time  before  
and
 
after
 
their
 
shifts
 
to
 
initiate
 
conversations,
 
provide
 
any
 
support
 
or
 
guidance,
 
and
 
get
 
to
 
know
 
them
 
on
 
a
 
human
 
level.
 
 ▢  Be  accommodating.  We  often  ask  for  a  lot  of  ﬂexibility  from  our  staﬀ  as  we  try  to  accommodate  
our
 
clients.
 
We
 
need
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
we
 
try
 
to
 
be
 
ﬂexible
 
for
 
staﬀ
 
requests
 
for
 
time
 
oﬀ
 
as
 
well.
 
Therefore,
 
it
 
is
 
important
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
clear
 
policy
 
regarding
 
this
 
while
 
being
 
compassionate
 
to
 
schedule
 
changes
 
that
 
are
 
out
 
of
 
their
 
control.
 
 ▢  Schedule  regular  staﬀ  meetings  and  workshops:  Not  only  does  this  ensure  your  team  is  always  
on
 
the
 
same
 
page
 
and
 
collaborating
 
with
 
one
 
another,
 
but
 
it
 
also
 
gives
 
an
 
opportunity
 
for
 
staﬀ
 
to
 
socialize
 
and
 
build
 
relationships
 
with
 
one
 
another.
 
Go
 
a
 
step
 
further
 
and
 
have
 
teacher
 
input
 
on
 
topics
 
to
 
cover
 
or
 
even
 
lead
 
a
 
portion
 
of
 
the
 
workshops
 
 ○  TIP:  Plan  to  hold  at  least  one  staﬀ  meeting/workshop  every  quarter.  Even  tie  it  into  a  
social
 
opportunity
 
(snacks,
 
social
 
activity,
 
sporting
 
event,
 
etc.)
 
to
 
further
 
build
 
your
 
team’s
 
camaraderie!
 ▢  Don’t  underestimate  the  power  of  saying  ‘thank  you’:  Be  appreciative  of  their  time  and  energy!  
Celebrate
 
them
 
on
 
their
 
birthdays,
 
with
 
Teacher
 
of
 
the
 
Month,
 
and
 
any
 
other
 
accomplishments
 
in
 
their
 
lives.
 
 ▢  Always  be  interviewing:  This  will  alleviate  the  stress  your  staﬀ  feels  with  any  sudden  
resignations.
 
Additionally,
 
this
 
will
 
help
 
you
 
improve
 
your
 
interviewing
 
skills.

Chapter  10:  Human  Resources    
Getting  Started:  The  Hiring  Process  
Step  1:  Develop  Job  Descriptions  ●  There  are  a  number  of  job  posting  templates  available  for  the  following  positions  in  IQ’s  Internal  
Server
 
Documents
 
>
 
Operations
 
-
 
Human
 
Resources:
 
 ○  Part-time  Teacher  ○  Full-time  Education  Director/Centre  Coordinator  ●  Before  posting  the  job,  be  sure  to  modify  the  description  accordingly  with  your  location’s  
requirements.
 
 ●  Post  jobs  on  Indeed,  LinkedIn,  and  any  other  respected,  professional  platform.  If  you  are  located  
near
 
any
 
universities
 
or
 
colleges,
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
great
 
resource
 
to
 
ﬁnd
 
specialized
 
subject
 
teachers
 
and/or
 
students
 
in
 
teacher’s
 
college.
  
Step  2:  Develop  an  Ongoing  Applicant  Pool  &  Filter  Potential  Candidates  ●  Advertise  for  the  potential  positions  on  a  regular  basis  and  update  job  postings  monthly.   ●  When  you  receive  new  resumes,  ensure  you  review  the  resumes  and  set  folders  up  in  your  
location’s
 
Google
 
Drive
 
to
 
store
 
the
 
resumes
 
of
 
those
 
candidates
 
who
 
have
 
piqued
 
your
 
interest
 
from
 
the
 
very
 
beginning
 
for
 
elementary,
 
secondary
 
math
 
and
 
science,
 
secondary
 
English,
 
and
 
French.
 ●  For  those  who  you  are  interested  in  after  your  initial  resume  ﬁlter,  ask  them  to  complete  a  
Prospective
 
Teacher
 
Qualiﬁcation
 
and
 
Availability
 
Statement
 
(IQ’s
 
Internal
 
Server
 
Documents
 
>
 
Operations
 
-
 
Human
 
Resources).
 
This
 
will
 
help
 
with
 
ﬁltering
 
potential
 
candidates
 
based
 
on
 
teachables
 
and
 
availability.
 
 ●  Regardless  of  vacancies,  you  should  conduct  interviews  on  a  regular  basis.  Regular  interviewing  
will
 
prevent
 
undue
 
stress
 
when
 
unexpected
 
vacancies
 
arise,
 
and
 
it
 
will
 
also
 
help
 
improve
 
your
 
interviewing
 
skills.
 
  
Step  3:  Review  the  Candidates  ●  Review  completed  Prospective  Teacher  Qualiﬁcation  and  Availability  Statements  and  determine  
whose
 
teachables
 
and
 
availability
 
best
 
matches
 
your
 
location’s
 
requirements.
 
 ●  Review  resumes  and  cover  letters  to  ensure  applicants  meet  certiﬁcation  requirements.   ●  Verify  the  candidates’  distance  from  the  location.  Ideally,  you  will  want  to  avoid  moving  forward  
with
 
a
 
candidate
 
whose
 
drive
 
is
 
more
 
than
 
30
 
minutes.
 
 ●  Schedule  a  telephone  interview  through  email.  Give  the  applicant  a  few  options  for  dates/times.

Chapter  10:  Human  Resources    
Step  4:  Telephone  Interview  ●  Conduct  a  telephone  interview  using  the  Telephone  Interview  Questions  (IQ’s  Internal  Server  
Documents
 
>
 
Operations
 
-
 
Human
 
Resources).
 ○  TIP:  Budget  10-15  minutes  for  this  telephone  interview.  ●  The  objective  is  to  screen  potential  candidates  to  see  if  they  should  receive  a  full  interview.   ●  During  this  call,  evaluate  candidates’  verbal  communication  skills  and  general  personality.   ●  Explain  the  speciﬁcs  about  the  current  position  you  are  interviewing  candidates  for  -  e.g.  
elementary
 
teacher
 
to
 
work
 
Mondays
 
and
 
Wednesdays
 
from
 
4
 
to
 
8
 
p.m.
 
 ●  If  the  candidate  satisﬁes  your  requirements,  schedule  an  in-person  interview.    
Step  5:  In-Person  Interview   ●  Conduct  a  full  interview  using  the  In-Person  Interview  Questions  (IQ’s  Internal  Server  Documents  
>
 
Operations
 
-
 
Human
 
Resources).
 
 ●  Review  the  candidate’s  resume,  notes  from  the  telephone  interview,  and  interview  questions  in  
advance.
 ●  A  great  interview  will  consist  of  the  candidate  speaking  the  majority  of  the  time  and  the  
interviewer
 
being
 
an
 
active
 
listener.
 
 ●  Throughout  the  interview,  you  should  be  able  to  evaluate  their  personality,  professionalism,  core  
competencies,
 
and
 
passion.
 
 ●  After  the  interview  questions,  you  should  always  administer  proﬁciency  tests  for  prospective  
teachers.
 
 ○  For  example,  if  they  say  they  can  teach  grade  12  physics  on  the  Prospective  Teacher  
Qualiﬁcation
 
and
 
Availability
 
Statement
,
 
then
 
have
 
them
 
complete
 
select
 
questions
 
from
 
a
 
grade
 
12
 
physics
 
exam,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
having
 
them
 
teach
 
you
 
the
 
concepts
 
so
 
you
 
feel
 
conﬁdent
 
they
 
not
 
only
 
know
 
the
 
information,
 
but
 
they
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
teach
 
it.
 ●  After  the  interview,  review  their  answers  to  both  your  interview  questions  as  well  as  the  
proﬁciency
 
tests.
 
Ask
 
yourself:
  
 ○  Will  this  candidate  add  value  to  the  location?   ○  Do  they  have  the  interpersonal  skills  to  build  relationships  with  students?   ○  Are  they  passionate  about  teaching?  ●  If  they’re  a  strong  candidate,  ask  for  two  references  prior  to  them  leaving.  ●  Always  thank  them  for  their  time  and  explain  the  next  steps.    
Step  6:  Reference  Check  ●  If  you’re  planning  to  move  forward  and  hire  the  candidate,  a  Reference  Check  Form  (IQ’s  Internal  
Server
 
Documents
 
>
 
Operations
 
-
 
Human
 
Resources)
 
should
 
be
 
completed
 
immediately
 
with
 
the
 
two
 
references
 
the
 
candidate
 
provided.

Chapter  10:  Human  Resources    
Step  7:  Offer  of  Employment  ●  Contact  the  successful  candidate  via  email  to  oﬃcially  oﬀer  them  the  position,  and  suggest  a  time  
for
 
them
 
to
 
come
 
in
 
to
 
complete
 
paperwork
 
and
 
set
 
up
 
their
 
training
 
schedule
 
if
 
they
 
accept.
 ○  Ask  them  to  bring  in  a  new  Vulnerable  Sector  Police  Check  (VSPC)  or  get  them  to  begin  
this
 
process.
 
 ○  Note:  As  a  requirement  of  Scholars  insurance,  all  staﬀ  members  (if  not  currently  
employed
 
by
 
a
 
school
 
board)
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
VSPC
 
on
 
ﬁle
 
with
 
Scholars.

tax
 
forms,
 
and
 
any
 
other
 
required
 
documents
 
for

Each
 
employee
 
must
 
have
 
all
 
of
 
these
 
items
 
in
 
their
 
ﬁle
 
before
 
being
 
given
 
access

material,
 
including
 
training
 
documents.
 ●  Once  these  documents  have  been  completed,  discuss  a  training  date  and  future  scheduling.   
 
Step  8:  Staff  Training   ●  Organize  your  new  staﬀ  member’s  training  schedule.   ○  Note:  all  staﬀ  receive  pay  for  all  training  hours  either  in-  or  out-  of  the  centre.  ●  Keep  in  mind  that  all  staﬀ  should  experience  a  gradual  release  of  responsibility.  Staﬀ  must  be  
given
 
enough
 
time
 
to
 
work
 
through
 
and
 
absorb
 
the
 
information
 
and
 
systems
 
you
 
are
 
asking
 
them
 
to
 
apply.
 
Therefore,
 
you
 
must
 
allow
 
appropriate
 
training
 
time
 
before
 
a
 
teacher
 
starts
 
with
 
their
 
own
 
group
 
of
 
students.

Step  9:  Identify  Potential  Vacancies  and  Teaching  Needs   ●  It  is  important  to  consistently  evaluate  and  identify  potential  vacancies.  ●  April  is  a  great  time  to  start  thinking  ahead  for  the  next  school  and  staﬃng  needs  for  the  location.  
This
 
is
 
also
 
a
 
great
 
time
 
to
 
ask
 
current
 
staﬀ
 
what
 
their
 
plans
 
are
 
for
 
the
 
summer.
 
 ●  First,  speak  with  current  staﬀ  and  determine  their  plans  for  the  fall.  If  they’re  continuing  
employment,
 
are
 
they
 
keeping
 
the
 
same
 
schedule
 
or
 
will
 
their
 
availability
 
be
 
changing?
 
 ●  Once  you  have  determined  which  of  your  current  staﬀ  are  staying,  create  job  postings  for  
positions
 
that
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
ﬁlled.
 
It’s
 
important
 
to
 
start
 
this
 
process
 
early
 
as
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
ensure
 
you
 
hire
 
the
 
best
 
candidate
 
for
 
any
 
vacancies.

Chapter  10:  Human  Resources    ●  Ensure  you  are  constantly  evaluating  your  teachers’  capabilities  and  strengths.  Conduct  
performance
 
reviews
 
regularly.
 ●  When  a  staﬀ  member  has  just  joined  your  team,  complete  mini-performance  reviews  monthly  
during
 
their
 
probation.
 
After
 
their
 
three-month
 
probation,
 
performance
 
reviews
 
should
 
be
 
completed
 
every
 
six
 
months.
 
 
Teacher  Training  
Pre-Training   Before  starting  their  training,  you  will  need  to  create  a  user  ID  and  password  for  the  teacher  on  IQ.  You  
will
 
then
 
share
 
the
 
Scholars
 
Teacher
 
Training
 
slidedeck
 
(Scholars
 
Google
 
Drive
 
Documents
 
>
 
Human
 
Resources)
 
with
 
the
 
teacher
 
to
 
complete
 
prior
 
to
 
any
 
observation
 
hours.
 
This
 
can
 
either
 
be
 
completed
 
in-location
 
during
 
their
 
introductory
 
training
 
session
 
(preferred)
 
or
 
at
 
home
 
prior
 
to
 
their
 
introductory
 
training
 
session
 
in-location
 
(alternative).
  
Introductory  Training  Session  
Tour  During  your  ﬁrst  training  session  with  the  new  teacher  in  the  location,  start  by  taking  them  on  a  tour,  
highlighting
 
areas
 
in
 
the
 
location
 
and
 
their
 
key
 
features:
  ●  Lobby   ●  Classroom(s)  ●  Washrooms  ●  Kitchenette  (if  applicable)  ●  Scholars  Store  
●  Manipulative  Shelf  ●  Teacher  Resource  Shelf  ●  Tablet  Storage  ●  The  Island  (student  binders,  tablet  storage,  etc.)   Centre  Speciﬁc  Policies  &  Procedures  While  our  standard  policies  are  outlined  in  the  Employment  Agreement  and  Employee  Handbook  the  
new
 
teacher
 
has
 
already
 
signed,
 
it
 
is
 
important
 
to
 
outline
 
any
 
speciﬁc
 
policies
 
or
 
procedures
 
of
 
your
 
location.
 
This
 
could
 
be
 
connected
 
to
 
items
 
like
 
punctuality
 
expectations,
 
cleaning
 
of
 
their
 
station,
 
outlining
 
expectations
 
for
 
if
 
a
 
parent
 
catches
 
them
 
at
 
the
 
door,
 
who
 
goes
 
to
 
the
 
door
 
to
 
let
 
students
 
in/out,
 
etc.
  Observation  Hours  After  understanding  the  Scholars  system  and  your  location  as  a  whole,  new  teachers  will  complete  a  
number
 
of
 
observation
 
hours.
 
This
 
is
 
an
 
opportunity
 
to
 
see
 
the
 
progression
 
of
 
the
 
teaching
 
hour,

Chapter  10:  Human  Resources    familiarize  themselves  with  the  binders  and  curriculum,  and  learn  how  to  eﬀectively  manage  our  small  
group
 
table
 
ratios.
  
  To  start,  new  teachers  should  spend  a  couple  of  hours  just  observing.  Provide  them  with  paper  and  a  pen  
to
 
make
 
notes
 
as
 
they
 
observe
 
a
 
mentor
 
teacher.
 
Next,
 
they
 
will
 
move
 
on
 
to
 
sitting
 
with
 
a
 
diﬀerent
 
mentor
 
teacher
 
and
 
working
 
with
 
one
 
of
 
their
 
students.
 
The
 
mentor
 
teacher
 
will
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
answer
 
any
 
questions
 
and
 
provide
 
guidance
 
along
 
the
 
way
 
while
 
the
 
new
 
teacher
 
can
 
begin
 
to
 
apply
 
their
 
knowledge
 
gained
 
from
 
their
 
pre-training
 
and
 
previous
 
observation
 
hours.
 
  The  Initial  Solo  Teaching  Hours  Once  you  are  conﬁdent  that  the  new  teacher  is  ready  to  begin  teaching  their  own  table,  start  with  a  low  
student-to-teacher
 
ratio
 
-
 
a
 
maximum
 
of
 
2:1
 
-
 
while
 
they
 
continue
 
to
 
build
 
their
 
skills
 
and
 
conﬁdence.
  During  these  initial  teaching  sessions,  a  member  of  the  management  team  should  be  observing  and  
supporting
 
the
 
teacher.
 
Appear
 
busy
 
so
 
as
 
to
 
not
 
intimidate
 
the
 
new
 
teacher
 
and
 
make
 
notes
 
on
 
the
 
teacher’s
 
ability
 
to
 
handle
 
to
 
following:
  ●  Preparation  for  the  hour  ●  The  ratio  
●  The  curriculum  and  program  ●  The  end-of-class  transitions   
Once
 
the
 
shift
 
has
 
been
 
completed,
 
meet
 
with
 
the
 
new
 
teacher
 
to
 
discuss
 
their
 
ﬁrst
 
sessions.
 
Ensure
 
you
 
are
 
providing
 
more
 
positive
 
than
 
negative
 
feedback
 
during
 
this
 
time
 
and
 
review
 
the
 
two
 
most
 
important
 
changes
 
or
 
additions
 
you
 
would
 
like
 
to
 
see
 
for
 
next
 
time.
 
Be
 
sure
 
to
 
give
 
positive
 
feedback
 
next
 
session
 
when
 
they
 
apply
 
these
 
changes!
  Sample  Introductory  Training  Schedule

Chapter  10:  Human  Resources    ●  First  solo  teaching  day:    Only  schedule  them  for  a  couple  of  hours  with  a  max  of  two  students  at  the  table.  A  director  should  be  readily  available  and  monitoring  from  the  island  for  support.   Note:  At  the  end  of  each  session  for  the  ﬁrst  few  weeks,  the  Director  should  touch  base  to  answer  questions,  provide  feedback,  and  next  steps   Ongoing  Training  Teachers  are  not  trained  after  just  a  couple  of  sessions  -  in  fact,  just  like  our  students,  teachers  should  
continuously
 
be
 
learning.
 
They
 
will
 
need
 
ongoing
 
training
 
for
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
two
 
to
 
three
 
months
 
depending
 
on
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
shifts
 
they
 
receive.
 
After
 
this
 
time,
 
they
 
should
 
be
 
having
 
biannual
 
performance
 
reviews.
  
The  Performance  Review  
Preparation  &  The  Observation  Hour  ▢  Prepare  for  the  Performance  Review  by  gathering  any  previous  performance  reviews  and  
feedback
 
forms
 
from
 
the
 
teacher’s
 
regular
 
students/parents.
 
 ▢  Schedule  an  observation  hour.  Remember  to  always  look  busy  while  doing  this.  ▢  Provide  the  teacher  with  the  blank  template  to  record  their  self-evaluation  before  adding  your  
notes
 
and
 
comments
 
to
 
it
 
prior
 
to
 
reviewing
 
the
 
results
 
with
 
your
 
teacher.
 ▢  Ensure  you  allow  enough  time  to  allow  for  a  detailed  discussion.   
The  Performance  Review  Meeting  ▢  Start  by  making  the  teacher  feel  comfortable.  This  is  not  something  that  either  one  of  you  should  
dread.
 
This
 
is
 
an
 
opportunity
 
to
 
continue
 
to
 
learn
 
and
 
grow.
 ▢  Ask  the  teacher  to  discuss  their  greatest  improvement  or  accomplishment  over  the  past  few  
months.
 
Take
 
notes
 
on
 
this.
 ▢  Discuss  the  teacher’s  portion  of  the  review  ﬁrst  and  then  present  your  portion  of  the  review.  Be  
sure
 
to
 
include
 
more
 
positives
 
than
 
negatives.
 
Highlight
 
only
 
a
 
few
 
areas
 
of
 
opportunity.
 
 ▢  Be  sure  to  end  on  a  high  note.  The  purpose  of  a  performance  review  is  to  motivate  the  
employees
 
and
 
encourage
 
them
 
to
 
continuously
 
work
 
toward
 
bettering
 
themselves.

Chapter  11:  Daily  Operations  and  Location  Organization    
Daily  Operations   On-Site  Greeting  &  Student  Safety  Every  time  someone  enters  your  location,  it’s  important  to  go  to  the  lobby  and  greet  them  -  by  name,  if  
they
 
are
 
an
 
existing
 
client.
 
We
 
can
 
sometimes
 
become
 
complacent
 
with
 
our
 
existing
 
clients
 
and
 
staﬀ,
 
and
 
just
 
wave
 
them
 
through.
  While  sessions  are  taking  place,  it’s  important  to  have  the  lobby-to-teaching  space  door  closed  and  have  
someone
 
from
 
the
 
team
 
designated
 
to
 
be
 
at
 
the
 
door
 
to
 
manage
 
the
 
comings
 
and
 
goings
 
of
 
students.
 
Students
 
should
 
never
 
simply
 
walk
 
into
 
the
 
space
 
or
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
space.
 
  This  closed  door  policy  also  ensures  that  there  is  a  physical  barrier  to  deter  parents/guardians  from  
walking
 
in
 
and
 
addressing
 
your
 
teachers.
 
The
 
designated
 
director
 
for
 
the
 
door
 
is
 
there
 
to
 
handle
 
any
 
questions
 
or
 
concerns
 
from
 
parents
 
so
 
that
 
your
 
teachers
 
can
 
focus
 
on
 
administering
 
the
 
best
 
sessions
 
possible
 
with
 
their
 
students
 
each
 
hour.
 
 The  Rule  of  Two  Aligned  with  having  a  director  dedicated  while  sessions  are  happening  to  monitor  the  comings  and  
goings
 
of
 
students,
 
the
 
Rule
 
of
 
Two
 
is
 
another
 
important
 
policy
 
to
 
adhere
 
to.
 
The
 
Rule
 
of
 
Two
 
requires
 
that
 
no
 
fewer
 
than
 
two
 
unrelated
 
adults
 
be
 
present
 
at
 
all
 
times
 
with
 
a
 
child
 
in
 
the
 
location.
 
The
 
main
 
purpose
 
of
 
the
 
two-adult
 
rule
 
is
 
to
 
increase
 
accountability
 
and
 
decrease
 
isolation.
 
There
 
are
 
many
 
beneﬁts
 
to
 
having
 
two
 
sets
 
of
 
adult
 
eyes
 
on
 
any
 
given
 
situation
 
with
 
a
 
child,
 
including:
 ●  Signiﬁcantly  reducing  the  risk  of  an  incident  of  abuse  ●  Protecting  against  false  accusations  ●  Reducing  liability  and  a  possible  claim  of  negligence  ●  Oﬀering  additional  help  if  there  is  an  accident  or  emergency  
 Hours  of  Operation  The  minimum  hours  of  operation  are  located  within  your  Franchise  Agreement;  however,  it’s  important  to  
consider
 
extending
 
these
 
minimum
 
hours
 
as
 
locations
 
who
 
have
 
more
 
in-centre
 
open
 
hours
 
experience
 
better
 
lead
 
generation,
 
as
 
clients
 
are
 
more
 
likely
 
to
 
connect
 
with
 
a
 
location
 
that
 
is
 
currently
 
open
 
if
 
they
 
are
 
searching
 
Google
 
for”
 
tutoring
 
near
 
me”,
 
along
 
with
 
Google’s
 
search
 
algorithm
 
putting
 
search
 
preference
 
on
 
actively
 
open
 
locations.

IQ  Tools  
IQ  provides  you  with  a  variety  of  tools  for  successful  daily  operations.  Along  with  your  email  and  Google  
Calendar,
 
IQ
 
will
 
be
 
open
 
on
 
your
 
computer
 
at
 
all
 
times.
 
You
 
will
 
use
 
IQ
 
to:
 
Track  Leads  Enter  all  leads  into  the  system.  There  is  no  such  thing  as  a  “bad”  lead  -  although  someone  may  not  be  
interested
 
in
 
the
 
Scholars
 
Solution
 
at
 
this
 
time,
 
by
 
having
 
their
 
information
 
recorded
 
in
 
your
 
IQ,
 
you
 
will
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
connect
 
with
 
them
 
again
 
down
 
the
 
road
 
with
 
a
 
new
 
program
 
oﬀering
 
or
 
at
 
a
 
better
 
time
 
for
 
them.
 
Ensure
 
that
 
you
 
provide
 
detailed
 
notes
 
and
 
schedule
 
follow-ups.
  
Schedule  Assessments  and  Trial  Hours  In  addition  to  using  your  location’s  Google  Calendar  to  schedule  assessments  to  ensure  there  are  no  
double
 
bookings,
 
you
 
will
 
also
 
enter
 
this
 
information
 
into
 
IQ.
 
Use
 
the
 
details
 
from
 
the
 
assessment
 
chapter
 
to
 
determine
 
the
 
length
 
of
 
time
 
needed
 
to
 
complete
 
each
 
assessment.
 
However,
 
generally
 
speaking,
 
you
 
will
 
schedule
 
1.5-2
 
hours
 
for
 
students
 
six
 
and
 
older
 
and
 
one
 
hour
 
for
 
students
 
younger
 
than
 
six.
 
Since
 
this
 
is
 
usually
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
interaction
 
with
 
a
 
parent
 
and
 
student,
 
they
 
should
 
not
 
feel
 
rushed
 
at
 
any
 
time.
 
  
Track  Student  Attendance,  Programs,  Conferences  After  the  initial  entry,  IQ  will  track  and  update  the  student’s  program  based  on  the  scores  provided  by  the  
teacher,
 
which
 
a
 
director
 
will
 
ultimately
 
approve,
 
and
 
prepare
 
the
 
assignment
 
set
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
class.
 
It
 
will
 
also
 
provide
 
reminders
 
for
 
conferences.
  Every  student’s  pacing  and  progress  through  their  individualized  program  is  dependent  on  the  accuracy  
of
 
the
 
scores
 
that
 
are
 
entered
 
for
 
every
 
assignment
 
they
 
complete.
 
As
 
such,
 
it’s
 
important
 
for
 
a
 
director
 
to
 
spend
 
suﬃcient
 
time
 
truly
 
reviewing
 
each
 
assignment
 
set,
 
and
 
making
 
any
 
necessary
 
adjustments
 
to
 
the
 
marks
 
or
 
comments
 
before
 
the
 
assignment
 
set
 
is
 
submitted
 
and
 
locked.

Chapter  11:  Daily  Operations  and  Location  Organization    To  ensure  that  a  student’s  next  assignment  set  is  always  ready,  it’s  a  best  practice  to  approve  every  
assignment
 
set
 
in
 
IQ
 
(Assignments
 
Pending
 
Approval)
 
either
 
as
 
sessions
 
are
 
taking
 
place
 
every
 
day
 
or
 
at
 
the
 
beginning
 
of
 
the
 
next
 
day.
 
This
 
enables
 
you
 
to
 
accommodate
 
any
 
last-minute
 
schedule/make-up
 
requests
 
by
 
clients.
 
  When  submitting  every  assignment  set,  the  director  will  also  be  selecting  the  attendance  for  the  session.  
There
 
are
 
three
 
options
 
when
 
submitting
 
in
 
Assignments
 
Pending
 
Approval:
 
attended,
 
no
 
show,
 
or
 
make-up
 
(i.e.
 
make-up
 
session
 
owed).
  TIP:  If  you  have  a  student  who  is  completing  a  two-hour  session  due  to  scheduling  a  make-up  session  in  
advance
 
of
 
their
 
regularly
 
scheduled
 
session,
 
for
 
example,
 
you
 
must
 
have
 
a
 
director
 
ready
 
to
 
approve
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
assignment
 
set
 
for
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
hour
 
before
 
IQ
 
can
 
release
 
the
 
second
 
assignment
 
set
 
for
 
the
 
second
 
hour

Day  View/Week  View  Day  View/Week  View  are  two  versions  of  your  location’s  master  schedule,  with  visual  indicators  to  help

quickly.
  Visual  Indicators:  ●  Staﬀ   shifts  will  display  as  the  colour  set  in  their  Teacher  Proﬁle.  ●  Students  without  an  attendance  status  will  show  as  a  shade  of  the  teacher’s  colour  they  are  
scheduled
 
with
 
for
 
that
 
session.
 ●  Once  a  session  is  set  with  a  status,  it  will  change  to  one  of  the  following  colours:  ○  Blue  -  Attended  ○  Red  -  No  Show  ○  Brown  -  Make-Up  (i.e.  make-up  session  owed)  ●  For  Make-Up  sessions  that  have  been  scheduled  from  a  Make-Up  owed  session,  they  will  display

Chapter  11:  Daily  Operations  and  Location  Organization    
Schedule  Students   IQ’s  scheduling  tool  is  used  to  keep  track  of  all  students,  as  well  as  the  times  they  regularly  attend  the  
location.
 
Once
 
enrollment
 
documents
 
have
 
been
 
completed,
 
the
 
student
 
will
 
be
 
enrolled
 
in
 
a
 
program
 
and
 
have
 
a
 
schedule
 
created.
 
  Scheduling  is  completed  on  an  ongoing  basis  within  IQ.  It  provides  a  template  to  use  throughout  a  
student’s
 
entire
 
program
 
to
 
track
 
changes
 
and
 
additions,
 
which
 
makes
 
it
 
easier
 
to
 
uphold
 
and
 
monitor
 
table
 
tightness
 
and
 
teacher
 
cost.
 
Tables  are  kept  as  tight  as  possible  while  accommodating  for  student-to-teacher  ratios,  student  
personalities,
 
age
 
diﬀerences,
 
academic
 
materials,
 
etc.
 
It’s
 
also
 
vital
 
that
 
they’re
 
paired
 
with
 
the
 
teacher
 
that
 
they
 
will
 
work
 
best
 
with.
 
  The  maximum  student-to-teacher  ratio  for  GAP  programs  is  3:1 ;  whereas,  the  maximum  
student-to-teacher
 
ratio
 
for
 
Pre-Reading
 
Readiness,
 
Reading
 
Readiness,
 
French,
 
and
 
high
 
school
 
programs
 
is
 
2:1
.
 
  Rather  than  trying  to  group  all  students  of  the  same  age  and/or  ability  level  together,  you  will  ﬁnd  greater  
success
 
in
 
diversifying
 
your
 
tables.
 
For
 
example,
 
you
 
will
 
generally
 
not
 
ﬁnd
 
a
 
table
 
to
 
be
 
very
 
productive
 
if
 
there
 
are
 
three
 
grade
 
twos
 
placed
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
table.
 
Additionally,
 
it
 
is
 
recommended
 
to
 
not
 
schedule
 
more
 
than
 
one
 
“high-needs”
 
student
 
at
 
a
 
table
 
(e.g.,
 
ADD,
 
ADHD,
 
or
 
learning
 
exceptionality).
  Ensure  all  students’  scheduling  is  accurately  inputted  into  IQ  in  order  to  ensure  that  no  student  has  been  
missed
 
on
 
the
 
schedule.
 
Once
 
scheduling
 
has
 
been
 
completed,
 
review
 
the
 
daily,
 
weekly,
 
and
 
monthly
 
teacher
 
cost
 
report
 
generated
 
by
 
IQ
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
25%
 
benchmark
 
teacher
 
cost
 
is
 
being
 
achieved.
 
There
 
may
 
be
 
days
 
when
 
tables
 
can
 
be
 
consolidated
 
due
 
to
 
cancellations.
 
Determine
 
this
 
by
 
noon,
 
so
 
a
 
teacher
 
can
 
be
 
notiﬁed
 
of
 
a
 
cancelled
 
shift.
 
  If  a  student  is  unable  to  attend  one  of  their  scheduled  classes  and  provides  the  appropriate  notice  as  per  
the
 
Enrollment
 
Form
,
 
you
 
will
 
mark
 
them
 
as
 
“Make-Up”
 
-
 
indicating
 
that
 
a
 
make-up
 
session
 
is
 
owed.
 
A
 
list
 
of
 
all
 
owed
 
make-ups
 
is
 
provided
 
in
 
IQ
 
so
 
you
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
easily
 
schedule
 
these
 
owed
 
classes.
 
When
 
scheduling
 
a
 
make-up,
 
the
 
student
 
should
 
be
 
scheduled
 
where
 
there
 
is
 
already
 
a
 
spot
 
available
 
to
 
optimize
 
your
 
table
 
tightness.
 
Another
 
option
 
is
 
to
 
schedule
 
students
 
for
 
an
 
hour
 
prior
 
to
 
or
 
immediately
 
following
 
the
 
hour
 
of
 
their
 
regularly
 
scheduled
 
class.

Chapter  11:  Daily  Operations  and  Location  Organization    
Schedule  Teachers  &  Payroll  In  addition  to  scheduling  students’  lessons,  you  will  also  schedule  teachers’  shifts  for  IQ  to  provide  
payroll
 
reporting
 
and
 
a
 
detailed
 
teacher
 
cost
 
analysis.
 
IQ  provides  a  schedule  report  for  the  hours  each  teacher  worked.  Ensure  you  review  each  teacher’s  
schedule
 
entered
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
every
 
day
 
for
 
accuracy
 
to
 
prepare
 
for
 
the
 
upcoming

which
 
can

Complete  Billing  Only  two  forms  of  payment  options  should  be  presented  when  enrolling  clients:  pre-authorized  debit  or  
pre-authorized
 
credit
 
card.
 
Every
 
client
 
should
 
be
 
on
 
some
 
form
 
of
 
pre-authorized
 
payment
 
option
 
to
 
avoid
 
having
 
to
 
chase
 
them
 
for
 
payment.
 
All
 
clients
 
should
 
be
 
set
 
up
 
for
 
pre-authorized
 
payment
 
to
 
be
 
withdrawn
 
on
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
of
 
the
 
month
 
for
 
the
 
upcoming
 
month
 
of
 
classes
 
unless
 
a
 
diﬀerent
 
date
 
is
 
agreed
 
upon
 
during
 
enrollment.
 
(For
 
example,
 
processing
 
payment
 
on
 
the
 
5th
 
or
 
10th).
 
  By  the  second  of  the  month,  you  will  contact  any  parents  whose  payment  was  declined  or  NSF  and  verify  
merchant
 
report
 
deposit
 
amounts
 
match
 
bank
 
deposits.
 
  Monthly  Billing  Report  &  Mass  Payments  Action  
You  want  to  ensure  you  are  always  processing  payments  for  the  classes  scheduled  in  the  upcoming  
month
 
at
 
the
 
beginning
 
of
 
each
 
month.
 
This
 
sets
 
expectations
 
for
 
parents
 
and
 
also
 
coincides
 
with
 
the
 
policies
 
they
 
sign
 
in
 
the
 
Enrollment
 
Form.
 
If
 
you
 
bill
 
at
 
other
 
times,
 
you
 
may
 
ﬁnd
 
parents
 
asking
 
to
 
only
 
pay
 
for
 
the
 
classes
 
attended,
 
which
 
not
 
only
 
impacts
 
your
 
bottom
 
line,
 
but
 
also
 
severely
 
impacts
 
the
 
student’s
 
progress.
 
You
 
will
 
always
 
be
 
billing
 
for
 
a
 
minimum
 
of
 
eight
 
hours
 
per
 
month
 
since
 
students
 
attend
 
a
 
minimum
 
of
 
two
 
one-hour
 
sessions
 
for
 
each
 
subject
 
they
 
are
 
needing
 
support
 
with.
 
  While  initially  this  may  seem  daunting  to  calculate  every  month  for  each  student,  there  is  a  fantastic  
feature
 
in
 
IQ
 
-
 
The
 
Monthly
 
Billing
 
Report
 
-
 
that
 
will
 
do
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
calculating
 
for
 
you
 
based
 
on
 
each
 
student’s
 
recurring
 
schedule
 
and
 
program
 
rate.
  Within  IQ’s  Monthly  Billing  Report  you  will  also  ﬁnd  a  ‘Mass  Payments’  action,  which  allows  you  to  
transfer
 
the
 
payment
 
amounts
 
collected
 
via
 
your
 
payment
 
processor
 
into
 
IQ
 
to
 
maximize

Chapter  11:  Daily  Operations  and  Location  Organization    
View  Reports  IQ  provides  the  reports  necessary  when  analyzing  your  business  and  creates  the  Monthly  Franchise  
Report.
 
  Your  Monthly  Franchise  Report  (MFR)  is  due  by  the  5th  of  every  month  for  the  previous  month.  In  order  
to
 
submit
 
your
 
MFR,
 
you
 
must
 
have
 
all
 
students
 
scheduled
 
and
 
their
 
attendance
 
marked
 
for
 
the
 
previous
 
month.
  
  To  generate  your  MFR,  select  the  last  day  of  the  month  for  which  you  are  generating  the  MFR,  ensure  all  
local
 
marketing
 
expenses
 
for
 
the
 
month
 
are
 
accounted
 
for,
 
and
 
all
 
assignments,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
the

are
 
submitted
 
and
 
approved.
 
Without

Chapter  11:  Daily  Operations  and  Location  Organization     To  facilitate  this  methodology  with  your  management  team,  we  recommend  utilizing  the  ﬂags,  ﬁlters,  etc.  functionalities  of  G  Suite.   
Google  Reviews  Reviews  on  Google  provide  valuable  information  about  your  business  to  both  you  and  your  customers.  
Business
 
reviews
 
appear
 
next
 
to
 
your
 
listing
 
in
 
Maps
 
and
 
Search
 
and
 
can
 
help
 
your
 
business
 
stand
 
out
 on  Google.  You  can  request  reviews  from  customers  through  a  short  URL  that’s  speciﬁc  to  your  business.   
To  get  reviews  on  Google,  encourage  your  customers  to  spread  the  word  about  your  business  by  
following
 
these
 
best
 
practices:
 
●  Remind  your  customers  to  leave  reviews.  Let  them  know  that  it’s  quick  and  easy  to  leave  
business
 
reviews
 
on
 
mobile
 
devices
 
or
 
desktop
 
computers.
 
 ●  Reply  to  reviews  to  build  your  customers'  trust.  Your  customers  will  notice  that  your  business  
values
 
their
 
input
 
and
 
possibly
 
leave
 
more
 
reviews
 
in
 
the
 
future.
 
 
Reviews  are  only  valuable  when  they  are  authentic,  honest,  and  unbiased .  As  a  result,  you  shouldn't  
oﬀer
 
incentives
 
to
 
customers
 
in
 
exchange
 
for
 
reviews
 
-
 
and,
 
in
 
fact,
 
if
 
Google
 
discovers
 
this,
 
they
 
will
 
remove
 
the
 
review(s)
 
and
 
even
 
deactivate
 
your
 
Google
 
Business
 
Proﬁle.
 
Although
 
you
 
may
 
strive
 
for
 
a
 
perfect
 
5.0
 
rating
 
on
 
Google,
 
it
 
has
 
been
 
proven
 
that
 
potential
 
clients
 
will
 
often
 
trust
 
a
 
4.7
 
rating
 
more
 
than
 
a
 
5.0
 
rating
 
as
 
it
 
seems
 
more
 
genuine
 
and
 
realistic
 
-
 
no
 
one
 
is
 
perfect
 
after
 
all.
 
What
 
is
 
most
 
important
 
in
 
the
 
realm
 
of
 
Google
 
Reviews
 
is
 
that
 
you
 
are
 
obtaining
 
new
 
reviews
 
consistently.
 
It
 
is
 
obvious
 
that
 
you
 
were
 
doing
 
a
 
“campaign”
 
if
 
potential
 
clients
 
see
 
lots
 
of
 
reviews
 
in
 
February
 
and
 
September,
 
but
 
none

consistency
 
is

  Quick  Reference  Guide:  Handling  Objections  
Objection  Sample  Responses  
Cost  “That’s  really  expensive.”    
●  “Our  prices  are  reﬂective  of  the  personalization  of  our  programs  and  student  success  across  our  network.”  ●  “We  want  to  prove  to  you  why  our  program  is  the  best  and  share  the  value  we  can  oﬀer  to  you  and  your  child.  That  being  said,  can  you  tell  me  a  little  more  about  your  child  and  why  you  think  the  solution  is  too  expensive?”  
 Aﬀordability  “That’s  out  of  my  budget.”  
●  “ I  understand  that  Scholars  is  currently  out  of  your  budget.  We  would  love  to  help  your  child  when  the  time  is  right.  Let’s  connect  again  in  a  couple  of  months  to  see  if  anything  has  changed. ”  ●  “Is  there  anyone  else  in  the  family  who  can  help  pay  for  this  tutoring?  We  know  students  who  get  help  from  grandparents,  etc.”  
 Key  Decision-Maker  “I  need  to  speak  with  my  partner.”   
●  “ I  understand  completely.  I  will  send  a  follow-up  email  outlining  all  of  the  information  that  we  just  discussed  for  you  to  share.  I  will  also  share  some  available  days  and  times  in  the  upcoming  days  for  us  to  hop  on  a  call  or  schedule  an  on-site  visit  for  you  all  to  come  in  for  a  meeting  so  we  can  discuss  with  your  family.”   ●  “I’ll  send  you  a  follow-up  email  with  everything  we  just  discussed.  Then,  I’ll  give  you  and  your  partner  a  call  tomorrow  after  you’ve  had  a  chance  to  go  over  the  details  together.”
 
Rushing  “I  don’t  have  that  much  time  right  now.  Just  send  me  the  information.”  
●  “ I  hear  you  -  it’s  a  crazy  time  of  year!  In  order  to  provide  you  with  some  speciﬁc  information  for  your  child’s  personalized  programming,  can  I  ask  you  just  three  questions?”    ●  “We  know  all  about  busy  schedules!  Our  team  at  Scholars  is  well-versed  in  managing  students  who  require  schedule  ﬂexibility.  How  about  I  call  you  back  at  xx  or  yy?”  
 Scheduling   “We  don’t  have  time  to  come  two  hours  per  week!”  
●  “I’m  hearing  that  your  child  goes  to  hockey  practice  three  times  a  week.  That’s  a  big  commitment!  But  just  like  in  hockey,  practice  is  essential  for  building  conﬁdence,  competency,  and  passion  for  reading.  Could  you  squeeze  in  an  hour  right  after  school  twice  a  week?”  ●  “We  absolutely  understand  how  busy  schedules  can  be.  That’s  why  our  program  is  designed  to  make  the  biggest  impact  in  the  least  amount  of  time  possible:  two  hours  per  week  ensures  retention  while  building  healthy  learning  habits  and  routines.”

 Objection  Sample  Responses  
Ratios  and  Home-Tutoring   “We  want  a  1:1  tutor.”   “We  want  a  tutor  who  will  come  to  our  house.”   
●  “Our  locations  are  designed  to  mimic  a  classroom  on  a  smaller  scale,  which  makes  it  easier  for  our  students  to  transfer  their  understanding  to  their  school  classroom  with  conﬁdence!”   ●  ”Our  students  thrive  in  this  3:1  ratio  and  show  the  same  –  if  not  better  –  results  than  1:1  tutoring.  In  a  3:1  setting,  students  receive  personalized  attention,  but  they  also  have  the  opportunity  to  develop  their  own  skills,  strategies,  and  habit  toolbox,  without  immediately  relying  on  their  tutor  for  help.  Plus,  they  get  to  develop  essential  social  skills  too!”  
 Homework   “Do  you  give  homework?  We  want  more  practice.”  
●  “Our  philosophy  is  to  take  the  burden  oﬀ  the  parent,  so  most  of  our  students  do  not  take  additional  work  home!  The  program  is  designed  to  be  successful  without  it.  Having  said  that,  I’m  happy  to  share  some  great  books  for  you  and  your  child  to  read  together  at  home.”  
 
School  Supports  “My  child  has  an  EA  and  their  IEP  was  just  updated.”  
●  “I’m  so  happy  that  your  child  has  an  EA!  However,  an  EA  is  an  accessibility  aid  intended  to  make  classroom  material  more  accessible;  it’s  not  going  to  provide  personalized  lessons  or  ﬁll  the  knowledge  gaps  from  previous  grade  levels.  That’s  where  we  come  in!”  
 
Child’s  Personality   “My  child  hates  school.”  
●  “Students  who  struggle  in  school  often  thrive  at  Scholars  due  to  the  small  ratios,  our  Enrich,  Enhance,  Extend  approach,  and  our  personalized  programs,  which  ensure  that  each  child’s  lessons  are  exactly  aligned  with  their  existing  knowledge.  They  won’t  feel  overwhelmed  by  challenging  concepts  like  they  might  be  at  school!”  
 
 Competitors  “I’m  going  to  call  around  to  other  tutoring  companies  before  I  make  any  commitments.”   
●  “Great  idea!  We  absolutely  encourage  you  to  do  your  research  prior  to  enrolling.  Based  on  what  I’ve  heard  about  your  child,  I  have  some  questions  you  should  be  asking  when  you  call  around:  ○  What  are  their  student-to-teacher  ratios?  /  Do  they  start  with  an  assessment  to  personalize  their  lessons?  Do  they  oﬀer  reassessments  after  36  hours  in  the  program?  /  Do  they  provide  progress  updates  to  you  every  12  hours,  if  at  all?  /  Do  they  oﬀer  a  Team  Approach  to  learning?  /  What  are  their  teachers’  education  levels?  /  Do  they  use  “oﬀ-paper”  tools  and  resources  to  engage  diﬀerent  learning  styles?  Or  do  they  just  use  worksheets?  I  will  include  these  questions  in  my  follow-up  email!”

Quick  Reference  Guide:  Mastery  Learning   
 
 
 
Quick  Reference  Guide:  Mastery  Learning  
Mastery  learning  is  an  instructional  approach  where  educational  progress  is  based  on  performance  rather  than  time  spent.  Learners  are  given  multiple  
opportunities
 
and
 
are
 
assessed
 
repeatedly
 
until
 
they
 
reach
 
the
 
required
 
mastery
 
level.
 
This
 
ﬁnal
 
level
 
of
 
achievement
 
remains
 
the
 
same
 
for
 
all,
 
but
 
the
 
time
 
to
 
master
 
it
 
can
 
vary.
  
At  Scholars,  students  achieve  mastery  of  a  concept  when  they  are  able  to  achieve  100%  on  the  ﬁrst  two  activities  or  four  activities  at  or  above  80% .  
They
 
then
 
progress
 
to
 
the
 
next
 
concept
 
within
 
that
 
skill.
 
It’s
 
important
 
to
 
note
 
that
 
mastery
 
does
 
not
 
imply
 
that
 
they
 
will
 
always
 
remember
 
that
 
concept
 
or
 
never
 
need
 
to
 
review
 
again;
 
it
 
simply
 
means
 
that,
 
at
 
that
 
time,
 
the
 
student
 
had
 
successfully
 
demonstrated
 
proﬁciency
 
with
 
the
 
concept.
  
Achievement  Codes  for  Conferences:  Rating  Internal  Explanation  Example  External  Explanation  
Advanced  In  the  ﬁrst  two  activities  of  the  concept,  the  student  was  able  to  achieve  two  consecutive  scores  of  100% .  
100%,  100%  The  student  demonstrated  proﬁciency  with  the  concept  quickly  and  with  ease .  
Accomplished  In  the  ﬁrst  four  activities  of  the  concept,  the  student  was  able  to  achieve  four  consecutive  scores  at  or  above  80%.  
80%,  80%,  90%,  80%   
The  student  demonstrated  proﬁciency  with  the  concept  after  minimal  reinforcement  and  review .  
Expanding  In  the  ﬁrst  six  activities  of  the  concept,  the  student  was  able  to  achieve  four  scores  at  or  above  80%.  
60%,  70%,  80%,  90%,  90%,  80%  
The  student  required  some  practice  and  reinforcement  of  the  concept  to  achieve  proﬁciency.   
Developing  In  the  ﬁrst  eight  activities  of  the  concept,  the  student  was  able  to  achieve  four  scores  at  or  above  80%.
